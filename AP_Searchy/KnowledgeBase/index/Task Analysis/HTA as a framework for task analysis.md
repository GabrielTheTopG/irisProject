Thus Duncan (1972) argues that task analysis should be neutral with respect to solution

The word ‘task’ is defined in terms of stating the problem that people with system responsibilities are charged with resolving. Thus task is treated as complementary to behaviour and not synonymous with it. Task analysis, it is suggested, is a process of examining the human-task interaction in order to establish methods to ensure an appropriate ‘fit’ to meet system requirements, or to identify reasons why there is not an appropriate fit in a given operational configuration

Preece et al. (1994:417) have drawn a distinction between CTA and HTA, representing HTA as ‘concerned with establishing an accurate description of the steps that are required in order to complete a task’ whereas the focus in CTA is to ‘capture some representation of the knowledge that people have, or need to have in order to complete the task

- ## Comparison

successful performance in all tasks depends upon the interaction between physical and cognitive elements. Moreover, in a practical project, if part of a task is not critical, then it does not warrant attention, no matter how interesting it is from a cognitive perspective.

- ## Comparison
#Comparison #CTA #HTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
important point about CTA methods is that their authors are attempting to exploit principles of cognition in their choice of constraints on task descriptions regarding, for example, the means by which syntax is parsed or the manner in which declarative knowledge is compiled to acquire skill

- ## Comparison

distinguish between cognitive task elements, representing the problems with which operators or users are required to cope, and cognitive skills, concerned with operating upon information gained from the environment in order to guide subsequent physical actions

- ## Comparison
#Comparison #CTA #HTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Cognitive task elements can be inferred through HT A by stating plans. If different actions are consistently carried out in different circumstances, then a decision process can be inferred that can feature as an operation as part of a redescription, even though decision-making was not apparent through observation or through talking to the operator

- ## Comparison
#Comparison #CTA #HTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
A final necessary link between CTA and a form of task analysis that records operational requirements, such as HTA, is that practical insights gained from CTA, either problem hypotheses or design hypotheses need to be evaluated

- ## Comparison
#Comparison #CTA #HTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
All performance entails an interaction between cognition and action, so it is difficult to understand why some tasks are assumed, from the outset, to warrant a specialist form of cognitive task analysis, while others are not

Should a specialist method of cognitive task analysis or cognitive modelling be required in examining any particular aspect of task behaviour, then this will become clear as the task analysis develops

Moreover, considering cognition within the context of a real task will indicate whether effort to examine it in detail really is justified.

Thus, detail in HTA is dictated less by considerations of behaviour than by consideration of criticality in terms of the system under scrutiny

HTA deliberately avoided adopting constraining notations in order to maximize flexibility and to ensure that task descriptions could be understood equally by operational personnel and human factors staff

Task analysis should proceed by identifying the main work goal associated with the problem

Constraints are particularly important in practical projects as they affect the design options that might be adopted to realize goals. Constraints include detail about the work environment that are assumed to influence performance

Some form of cost-benefit analysis, suited to routine application within task analysis, needs to be applied quickly, efficiently and repeatedly. Of particular concern is that cost-benefits change as an analysis progresses and a greater number of opportunities for deferring costs present themselves

Record keeping shows what progress has been made, how the task has been represented and what design hypotheses have been proposed. It may also be useful to record the hypotheses that have been rejected on cost grounds, since these decisions may be revised as new issues emerge

current performance is judged to be unsatisfactory the analyst may examine the operator-system interaction to establish a cause or a solution to the problem. Different project aims may require hypotheses to be stated in terms of potential causes or design suggestions to overcome the problem.

tests (T) the environment against a specified criterion; then, if the test indicates a mismatch, operates (O) to affect change; then tests (T) again to determine whether the discrepancy has now been overcome; then exits (E) when the match is accomplished; if the match has not been accomplished, then (O) is repeated

Annett and Duncan (1967) similarly adopted the word ‘plan’ as the label for the co-ordinating unit in HTA, although it was only later (Duncan 1972, Shepherd 1976) that plans became necessary components in redescribing goals in HTA and their full benefits became apparent
