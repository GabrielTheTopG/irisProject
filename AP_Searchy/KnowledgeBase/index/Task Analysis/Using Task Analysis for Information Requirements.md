- ## HTA
#HTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
HTA was developed by John Annett and Keith Duncan in the 1960s as a general method for examining complex tasks (e.g., Annett & Duncan, 1967; Annett, Duncan, Stammers, & Gray, 1971; Duncan, 1972; Shepherd, 2001)

- ## Action
#Action #Concepts #HTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Actions are regulated by information gleaned from the system and can be described using Annett and Duncan’s input- action-feedback (I-A-F) classification

- ## Operations
#Operations #IAF #units #Concepts #HTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
An operation is a statement that briefly describes the operator’s current objective, expressed as an imperative. For example, the operation to correct a fault in a washing machine might be expressed as “repair washing machine.”

- ## Operations

An operation is stated in a way that is neutral with respect to its solution (Duncan, 1972, used the phrase “psychologically celibate”)

- ## Operations

It is important to distinguish between an operation and the behavior that enables it to be carried out

- ## Stopping
#Stopping #Rule #Decomposition #Concepts #HTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Annett and Duncan (1967) suggested a stopping rule that depends on analyst estimates of the probability of inadequate performance (P) and the cost of inadequate performance (C). Their stopping rule was that analysis should be taken no further than a level of redescription where the product of P and C was acceptable to the client. To estimate C, the analyst establishes what is of value in the system, including the money that might be lost (production costs) and the health and safety of personnel and the public

The P × C rule is a heuristic rather than a prescriptive arithmetic rule. Thus, if C is unacceptably high, further analysis is warranted no matter how low P is (assuming that it will not be a perfect zero). If C is quite high, it might still be worthwhile to explore the operation in greater detail, even where P is low

The stopping rule—or, more pertinently, the principle that the hierarchical description may be developed to different levels of detail in different places according to the importance of these places—means that the values of the system and not simply those of human factors are taken into proper account

- ## Stopping

To provide an unambiguous stopping point at which the analysis can be handed over to the interface designer, there needs to be a specification of the lowest level of operator task below which there should be no further decomposition

structure of process-control activities outlined by Annett and Duncan (1967). At any particular point in time, a process controller may have a subgoal to change the state of a system (by action), to observe the state of a system (by monitoring), to communicate information with or about a system (by communication), or to repair a system (by diagnosis)

- ## Plan
#Plan #Concepts #HTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
operation is decomposed into com- ponent operations, there needs to be an organizational system to indicate the conditions under which each component is carried out in order to complete the superordinate operation.

- ## Plan
#Plan #Concepts #HTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
some plans deal with sequences of activity, some with cycles of activity, and some with choices. Combining these in an HTA hierarchy results in apparently complex arrangements that are better understood by seeing how they result from the interaction of simpler plans.

#Plan #Concepts #HTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
The inclusion of plans in HTA recognizes the importance of indicating the conditions under which component operations are carried out in order to satisfactorily complete a task goal. Including sequencing elements in the SGT method was, to some design researchers, contro- versial, because it mixes data and control flow in the same specification (e.g., Benyon, 1992). However, as Ormerod (2000) argued, sequences of operations dictate information requirements as much as operations themselves

- ## Sequences
#Sequences #Plan #Concepts #HTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Operations may follow each other in a strict and mandatory sequence

- ## Sequences
#Sequences #Plan #Concepts #HTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Operations can be contingent on the outcomes of earlier operations or contextual factors and so arise in a sequence only if the necessary preconditions exist

Operations may not have a predetermined order but may instead be undertaken as and when the operator wishes to do so
