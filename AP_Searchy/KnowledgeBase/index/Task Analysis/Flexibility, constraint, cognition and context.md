Indeed, cognitive task analysis methods may reveal facets of human behaviour which HTA does not entertain. There is a danger that such methods do not fully account for the task context in which applied cognition is situated with the consequence that they investigate cognition for its own sake without reference to where operators need to concentrate their effort.

art of the difficulty in distinguishing between cognitive task analysis methods and other forms of task analysis is that the analyst is required to make a prior judgement on whether a task is ‘cognitive’ or whether it is not. This view is flawed because all tasks rely on processes of cognition to ensure they are carried out effectively. They require information to be monitored, an appropriate response to be selected and the consequences of actions to be evaluated to ensure that actions are adapted and controlled appropriately

flexibility of human behaviour has prompted some writers to champion methods of cognitive task analysis, which aim to explore the ways in which people deploy cognitive processes when they carry out tasks. Cognitive task analysis methods include methods for examining behaviour and for representing the way task knowledge is organised and the processes through which operators deploy knowledge and skill to demonstrate their expertise21

Cognitive operations are those operations that are driven substantially by cognition in order to make complex decisions, rather than simply to guide actions. Cognitive operations include problem solving and system monitoring. Much of what we understand by ‘cognition’ in task performance is covert and has to be inferred by the analyst

By ‘cognitive operations’ is meant those mental operations when operators use information gleaned from an interface in conjunction with their own knowledge, in order to make decisions and choices concerning how to proceed towards a working goal.

The process of inferring the presence of a cognitive task element within the context of a task analysis is assisted by identifying what the task is supposed to achieve

Sometimes managers favour a particular type of solution to a problem because it is less intrusive than other types of solution. For example, a manager might require that personal selection is dealt because it avoids making costly and intrusive engineering solutions.

all jobs are constrained to a greater or lesser extent. They are constrained with regard to the system’s goals that the operator is expected to attain. People are employed so that they work towards the organisatiorTs goals. This means that the person is expected to adapt behaviour to ensure that goals are attained.

Even where different people appear to do the same thing, they may be doing it in a different way, using different strategies and different psychological resources. On confronting a particular set of circumstances, one person might take stock and think through what needs to be done. Another person may adapt a response to a similar situation.
