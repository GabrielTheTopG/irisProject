Thus a task analysis methodology both specifies what kinds of task information are likely to be useful to analyze and provides a heuristic test for whether the task has actually been understood

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Analyzing a task into Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection rules (GOMS) is an established method for characterizing a user’s procedural knowledge. When combined with additional theoretical mechanisms, the resulting GOMS model provides a way to quantitatively predict human learning and performance for an interface design

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA, see Annett, Duncan, Stammers, & Gray, 1971; Kirwan & Ainsworth, 1992; chap. 3) but with the special advantage of being able to generate useful predictions of learning and performance.

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
A GOMS model is a description of the procedural knowledge (see chap. 15) that a user must have in order to carry out tasks on a device or system; it is a representation of the “how to do it” knowledge that is required by a system in order to get the intended tasks accomplished

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
GOMS model consists of descriptions of the Methods needed to accomplish specified Goals. The Methods are a series of steps consisting of Operators that the user performs. A Method may call for subgoals to be accomplished, so the Methods have a hierarchical structure. If there is more than one Method to accomplish a Goal, then Selection Rules choose the appropriate Method depending on the context

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
GOMS starts after a basic task analysis. In order to apply the GOMS technique, the task analyst must first determine what goals the user will be trying to accomplish. The analyst can then express in a GOMS model how the user can accomplish these goals with the system being designed

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
GOMS represents only the procedural aspects of a task. GOMS models can account for the procedural aspects of usability; these concern the exact steps in the procedures that the user must follow, and so GOMS allows the analyst to determine the amount, consistency, and efficiency of the procedures that users must follow

- ## Error
#Error #Behavior #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
However, as presented at length in Wood (2000), if attention is restricted to errors in procedural tasks, and GOMS is used to represent procedural knowledge, substantial progress can be made

- ## Error
#Error #Behavior #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
The modern solution for computer programming is excep- tions, which provide an alternate flow of control to be used just for error handling, leaving the main body of the code uncluttered to represent only the normal activity of the program. Wood suggests that a similar approach would be the desirable extension to GOMS models

- ## Procedure
#Procedure #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
basic lesson from the painful history of cognitive psychology is that people have only a very limited awareness of their own goals, strategies, and mental processes in general.

- ## Procedure
#Procedure #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
The analyst will have to combine information from talking to users with considerations of how the task constrains the user’s behavior, and most importantly, observations of actual user behavior (see chap. 2). So, rather than asking people to describe verbally what they do, a better approach is having users demonstrate on the system what they do, or better yet, observing what they normally do in an unobtrusive way.

- ## Procedure
#Procedure #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
GOMS analysis of a task follows the familiar top-down decomposition approach. The model is developed top-down from the most general user goal to more specific subgoals, with primitive operators finally at the bottom

- ## Step4
#Step4 #Document  #Check #Analysis #Procedure #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
produce the complete GOMSL model, list the any analyst-defined operators used, along with a brief description of each one, and the assumptions and judgment calls made during the analysis

- ## Step4
#Step4 #Document  #Check #Analysis #Procedure #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
choose some representative task instances, and check on the accuracy of the model either by hand

- ## Step4
#Step4 #Document  #Check #Analysis #Procedure #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Examine the judgment calls and assumptions made during the analysis to determine whether the conclusions about design quality and the performance estimates would change radically if the judgments or assumptions were made differently

- ## Step3
#Step3 #Recursively #Expand #Method #Hierarchy #Procedure #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
If some of the operators are high-level, non- primitive operators, examine each one and decide whether to provide a method for performing106 KIERAS it. The basis for the decision is whether additional detail is needed for design purposes

- ## Step3
#Step3 #Recursively #Expand #Method #Hierarchy #Procedure #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
writing a method for each goal in terms of high-level operators, and then replacing the high-level operators with another goal/method set, until the analysis has worked down to the finest grain size desired.

- ## Step3
#Step3 #Recursively #Expand #Method #Hierarchy #Procedure #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Each step should be a single natural unit of activity; heuristically, this is just an answer to the question “how would a user describe how to do this?” Make the steps as general and high-level as possible for the current level of analysis. A heuristic is to consider how a user would describe it in response to the instruction “don’t tell me the details yet.” Define new high-level operators, and bypass complex psychological processes as needed.

- ## Step3
#Step3 #Recursively #Expand #Method #Hierarchy #Procedure #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
If there is more than one method for accomplishing the goal, draft each method and then draft the selection rule set for the goal. A recommendation: defer consideration of minor alternative methods until later; especially for alternative “shortcut” methods.

- ## Step3
#Step3 #Recursively #Expand #Method #Hierarchy #Procedure #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
If all of the operators in a method are primitives, then this is the final level of analysis of the method, and nothing further needs to be done with this method

- ## Step2
#Step2 #Write #TopLevel #Method #Procedure #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
overall task has a unit-task type of control structure. This means that the user will accomplish the topmost goal (the overall task) by doing a series of smaller tasks one after the other.

- ## Step2
#Step2 #Write #TopLevel #Method #Procedure #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
The goal of performing the unit task typically is accomplished via a selection rule set, which dispatches control to the appropriate method for the unit task type, such as:

- ## Step1
#Step1 #Choose #TopLevel #Goals #Procedure #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
It is worthwhile to make the topmost goal, and the first level of subgoals, very high-level104 KIERAS to capture any important relationships within the set of tasks that the system is supposed to ad- dress

- ## Goal
#Goal #Concepts #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
A goal is something that the user tries to accomplish. The analyst attempts to identify and represent the goals that typical users will have. A set of goals usually will have a hierarchical arrangement in which accomplishing a goal may require first accomplishing one or more subgoals.

- ## Operators
#Operators #Concepts #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Operators are actions that the user executes. There is an important difference between goals and operators

- ## Mental
#Mental #Operators #Operators #Concepts #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
internal actions performed by the user; they are non-observed and hypothetical, inferred by the theorist or analyst. In the notation system presented here, some mental operators are “built in”; these are primitive operators that correspond to the basic mechanisms of the cognitive processor, the cognitive architecture

- ## External
#External #Operators #Operators #Concepts #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
External operators are the observable actions through which the user exchanges information with the system or other humans. These include perceptual operators, which read text from a screen, scan the screen to locate the cursor, or input a piece of speech, and motor opera- tors,

- ## Methods
#Methods #Concepts #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
A method is a sequence of steps that accomplishes a goal. A step in a method typically consists of an external operator, such a pressing a key, or a set of mental operators involved with setting up and accomplishing a subgoal

- ## Methods
#Methods #Concepts #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Methods often call submethods to accomplish goals that are subgoals.

- ## Selection
#Selection #Rules #Concepts #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
The purpose of a selection rule is to route control to the appropriate method to accomplish a goal. Clearly, if there is more than one method for a goal, then a selection rule is logically required.

- ## Selection
#Selection #Rules #Concepts #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
selection rule set is used exclusively to route control to the suitable method for a goal, and so can only have Accomplish_goal operators in the Then clause, while a Decide operator controls flow of control within a method, and can have any type of operator in the then clause

- ## Selection
#Selection #Rules #Concepts #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
if there is more than one method to accomplish a goal, use that goal as a general goal, and define separate methods to accomplish the more specific goals; use a selection rule set to dispatch control to the specific method.

- ## Task
#Task #Instance #Concepts #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
task description describes a generic task in terms of the goal to be accomplished, the situation information required to specify the goal, and the auxiliary information required to accomplish the goal that might be involved in bypassing descriptions of complex processes

- ## Task
#Task #Instance #Concepts #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
A task instance is a description of a specific task. It consists of specific values for all of the parameters in a task description. A set of task instances can be specified as task item objects whose property values can refer to other objects to form a linked-list sort of structure.

- ## Step
#Step #Concepts #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Steps. More than one operator can appear in a step, and at least one step in a method must contain the operator Return_with_goal_accomplished

- ## Judgment
#Judgment #Calls #Concepts #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
analyst is relying on a task analysis that involves judgments about how users view the task in terms of their natural goals, how they decompose the task into subtasks, and what the natural steps are in the user’s methods.

- ## Judgment
#Judgment #Calls #Concepts #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
analyst must often make judgment calls on these issues. These are decisions based on the analyst’s judgment, rather than on systematically collected behavioral data. In making judgment calls, the analyst is actually speculating on a psychological theory or model for how people do the task, and so will have to make hypothetical claims and assumptions about how users think about the task
