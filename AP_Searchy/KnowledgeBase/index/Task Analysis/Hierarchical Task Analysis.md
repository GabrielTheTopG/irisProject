Hierarchical task analysis (HTA) was developed at the University of Hull in the late 1960s in response to the need for a rational basis for understanding the skills required in complex non- repetitive operator tasks, especially process control tasks

- ## Step1
#Step1 #Defining #Purpose  #Analysis #Procedure #HTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
The purpose of the analysis has important implications for the way in which it is carried out, including the preferred data collection procedures, the depth of the analysis, and the kinds of solutions (results) that can be offered.

establish what the performance goals are and how one would know whether these goals have been attained

- ## Step2
#Step2 #Defining #Task #Goals #Procedure #HTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
For any goal, the key questions, which may be asked in many different forms, are these: (a) What objective evidence will show that this goal has been attained? and (b) What are the consequences of failure to attain this goal?

- ## Step2
#Step2 #Defining #Task #Goals #Procedure #HTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Answers to the second question may be used to evaluate the p × c criterion and hence the degree of detail of the analy- sis.

However, HTA is concerned with the functional aspects of the task, and actual behavior may not always be the best guide

- ## Step3
#Step3 #Define #Data #Acquisition #Procedure #HTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Interviewing the experts is often the best way to begin, particularly if the interviews focus on system goals, failures, and shortcomings. Direct observation may provide confirmatory information but, es- pecially in the case of nonroutine tasks, may yield relatively little information concerning uncommon events that may be critical

- ## Step4
#Step4 #Acquire #Data  #Draft #Decomposition #Procedure #HTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
The critical goal of HTA is to be able to relate what operators do (or are recommended to do) and why they do it and the consequences if it is not done correctly

use of standard notation generally helps in the construction of tables and diagrams as well as the interpretation of results, and it can also improve communication between analysts and stakeholders. The recommended notation system provides for each identified operation a unique number that may be used in both diagrams and tables

- ## Step4

The symbol “>” is used to indicate a sequence, “/” to represent an either/or decision, “+” to represent dual or parallel operations, and “:” to represent multiple operations in which timing and order are not critical.

iterative process is recommended wherever possible, with the full analysis being developed over a series of interviews and by cross-checking between sources such as training manuals and experienced operators (see chap. 2). The process of cross-checking not only provides the best guarantee of the reliability of the completed analysis but encourages the stakeholders to develop a sense of ownership of the analysis and consequently to share responsibility for recommendations arising from the results.

recommended criterion (the stop rule) is to stop the analysis of any given operation when the probability of performance failure multiplied by the cost to the system of performance failure (p × c) is acceptably low. The rationale for this general rule is that the analysis is essentially a search process aimed at identifying significant sources of actual or potential system failure, so when no more sources can be identified, then clearly the analysis should cease.

- ## Step7
#Step7 #Generate #Hypotheses #Procedure #HTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
HTA is principally carried out on the assumption that it is a tool to be used by a specialist who is looking for particular classes of problem and has a range of optional recommendations available. The analysis provides a means of generating hypotheses concerning the likely sources of actual or potential failure to meet overall task goals and to propose appropriate solutions.

- ## Step7
#Step7 #Generate #Hypotheses #Procedure #HTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
HTA simply provides an efficient procedure for identifying sources of actual or potential performance failure. However, Reason’s (1990) classification of human error, based on Rasmussen’s (1983) taxonomy of skill-based, rule-based, and knowledge-based performance, may be helpful in this context.

- ## Action
#Action #Concepts #HTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
action can be understood as an injunction (or instruction) to do something under specified circumstances, as illustrated by the T-O-T-E for hammering a nail into a piece of wood. Input and feedback both represent states or tests in the Miller et al. formulation

- ## Action
#Action #Concepts #HTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
action can be understood formally as a transformation rule (Annett, 1969, pp. 165–169), that is, a specification of how a servo responds to an error signal and its cancellation. For example, in a manual tracking task, the transformation rule can be specified by an equation, known as a transfer function, which quantifies the control output required to correct for an error signal of given direction and magnitude (McRuer & Krendel, 1959).

- ## Operations
#Operations #IAF #units #Concepts #HTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
An operation is defined by its goal(s) (or goals). It is further specified by (a) the circumstances in which the goal is activated (the I nput), (b) the activities (Action) that contribute to goal attainment, and (c) the conditions indicating goal attainment (Feedback)

- ## Operations
#Operations #IAF #units #Concepts #HTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
equivalent to T-O-T-E units (Miller et al., 1960) in that they are feedback (or servo) loops

- ## Operations
#Operations #IAF #units #Concepts #HTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Suboperations are included within higher order (or superordinate) operations, the attainment of each subgoal making a unique contribution to the attainment of superordinate goals

- ## Decomposition
#Decomposition #Concepts #HTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
HTA envisages two kinds of decomposition. The first comprises identifying those goal states specified by multiple criteria, for example, to arrive at a destination (an event) having expended minimum effort (variable 1) and with no injury (variable 2). The second kind of decomposition comprises the identification of subgoals in any routes that may be taken in attaining the overall goal state

- ## Stopping
#Stopping #Rule #Decomposition #Concepts #HTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
However, since the general purpose of HTA is to identify sources of actual or potential performance failure a general stop rule is common: Stop when the product of the probability of failure (p) and the cost of failure72 ANNETT (c) is judged acceptable.

- ## Stopping

p × c criterion (Annett & Duncan, 1967), and its prime benefit is that it keeps the analytical work down to the minimal amount and focuses the attention of the analyst on those aspects of the task that are critical to overall system success.

- ## Test
#Test  #State #Concepts #HTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
behavioral unit comprising a test of the goal state and an operate function connected in a recursive loop such that if the goal state tests negative, then operate is triggered, but if the goal state tests positive, then exit from the loop is permitted

- ## Test
#Test  #State #Concepts #HTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
basic feedback loop was called a Test-Operate-Test-Exit (T-O-T-E) unit.

- ## Plan
#Plan #Concepts #HTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
The specification of the rule, or rules, governing the order in which suboperations should be carried out is called a plan. Plans can be of various types, the commonest being simply a fixed sequence or routine procedure, such as “do this, then this, then this,” and so on. Another common type of plan specifies a selective rule or decision: “If x is the case, do this. If y is the case, do that

- ## Goal
#Goal #Concepts #HTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
goal is best stated as a specific state of affairs, formally a goal state. The goal state can be an event or some physically observable value of one or more variables that act as criteria of goal attainment and ultimately of system performance

- ## Task
#Task #Concepts #HTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
A task is “any piece of work that has to be done” (Shorter Oxford Dictionary, 1973). Every task may therefore be defined in terms of its goal or goals
