- ## Task
#Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Task analysis is treated here as the process of obtaining information about a task in order to generate hypotheses concerning sources of inadequate performance or about designs that will make things better. Task analysis entails examining performance of operators and examining the characteristics of systems that can influence performance. It also entails exploring practical constraints on design options to ensure that suggestions are realistic.

- ## Goals

System goal. The system goal is a statement of what the system is required to achieve. It follows that, since the operator is part of the system, he or she must carry out actions which are consistent with the system’s goals. Goals are expressed as an instruction or imperative, given in the form verb-action or a combination of such instructions.

Operator's goal. People direct their behaviour towards what they believe needs to be achieved. This is the operator s goal. Much of task analysis and human factors work is concerned with ensuring compliance between the system’s goal and the operator’s goal.

- ## Operations

The operation is that which the operator does to achieve a goal. It is the process of using resources to affect the system being controlled. An operation is a reference to the behaviour that the operator undertakes to achieve the goal.

- ## Plan

Plans. A plan in HTA describes the statement of the conditions under which each of a set of subgoals is undertaken to achieve their common superordinate goals.

- ## Task

A task is regarded as a problem to be solved or a challenge to be met. A task can be regarded as a set of things including, a system’s goal to be met, a set of resources to be used, and a set of constraints to be observed in using resources.
