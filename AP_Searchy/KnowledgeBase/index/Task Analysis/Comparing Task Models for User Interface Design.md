#Purpose #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Existing task models show a great diversity in terms of formalism and depth of analysis. They also are used to achieve a range of objectives (Bomsdorf & Szwillus, 1998, 1999):  To inform designers about potential usability problems, as in HTA (Annett & Duncan, 1967; chap. 3).  To evaluate human performance, as in GOMS (Card, Moran, & Newell, 1983; chap. 4).  To support design by providing a detailed task model describing task hierarchy, objects used, and knowledge structures, as in TKS (Johnson, 1992; chap. 15) or CTT (Patern `o, 1999; chap. 24).  To generate a prototype of a user interface, as in the Adept approach (Wilson & Johnson, 1996; chap. 24).

- ## Disciplines
#Disciplines #Characteristics #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Cognitive psychology or ergonomics (Stanton & Young, 1998). Task models are used to improve the understanding of how users may interact with a given user interface for carrying out a particular interactive task. Task analysis is useful for identifying the cognitive processes (e.g., data manipulation, thinking, problem solving) and structures (e.g., the intellectual skills and knowledge of a task)

- ## Disciplines
#Disciplines #Characteristics #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Task planning and allocation. Task models are used to assess task workload, to plan and allocate tasks to users in a particular organization, and to provide indicators to redesign work allocation to fit time, space, and other available resources (Kirwan & Ainsworth, 1992).

- ## Disciplines
#Disciplines #Characteristics #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Software engineering. Task models can capture relevant task information in an operational form that is machine understandable (see chap. 1). This is especially useful where a system needs to maintain an internal task representation for dynamic purposes, such as to enable adaptation to variations in the context of use (Lewis & Rieman, 1994; Smith & O’Neill, 1996).

- ## Disciplines
#Disciplines #Characteristics #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Ethnography. Task models can focus on how humans interact with a particular user interface in a given context of use

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #ConcurTaskTrees #CTT #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
ConcurTaskTrees (CTT), a model developed by Patern `o (1999; chap. 24), is based on five concepts: tasks, objects, actions, operators, and roles

- ## MUSE
#MUSE #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Method for USability Engineering (MUSE) is a structured human factors method aimed at helping designers consider human factors in the development of interactive software (Lim & Long, 1994). MUSE consists of three major phases: information elicitation and analysis, design synthesis, and design specification

- ## MUSE
#MUSE #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
task model is described using task hierarchies covering several concepts. At the top of the hierarchy is the organization, which may be conceptualized as a supersystem to be decomposed into subsystems, called jobs

#MUSE #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Each task is detailed with a termination event, a situational condition. The detection of unacceptable situational conditions may serve as a shortcut for terminating a path in the task tree. These constructs are used to describe uncertain events that may occur while the task is carried out.

- ## TKS
#TKS #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Task Knowledge Structure (TKS) method (Johnson & Johnson, 1989; chap. 15), the analysts manipulate a TKS, which is a conceptual representation of the knowledge a person has stored in his or her memory about a particular task (Fig. 6.6). A TKS is associated with each task that an agent (i.e., a user) performs. Tasks that an agent is in charge of are determined by the role the agent is presumed to assume. A role is defined as the particular set of tasks the agent is responsible for performing as part of his or her duty in a particular social context. An agent can take on several roles, and a role can be taken on by several agents.

- ## TKS
#TKS #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Constructors operate on tasks and by association on goals. The same goal can be reached by different subgoal sequencing. This leads to the concept of a plan. A plan is a particular arrangement of a set of subgoals and procedures for achieving a particular goal

- ## Task
#Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
any task analysis method may involve three related poles: 1. Models. A model captures some facets of the problem and translates them into specifi- cations. 2. A stepwise approach. An approach in which a sequence of steps is used to work on models. 3. Software tools. A software tool supports the approach by manipulating the appropriate models

- ## CTA
#CTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
task analysis methods used in cognitive analysis go beyond the goal level to analyze the cognitive workload, execution time, or knowledge required to carry out a set of tasks. In this respect, they are similar to user modeling.

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
engineering model for human performance to enable quantitative predictions (chap. 4). By incorporating tables of parameter values that rely on a cognitive architecture, GOMS can be used as an engineering approach to task design

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
There is no explicit task decomposition but only a hierarchical organization of methods used to operationalize tasks. Cognitive analysis in GOMS is done at unit task level, and it requires different levels of specification depending on the level of detail desired by the analyst.

- ## Decomposition
#Decomposition #Concepts #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
task decomposition stops at unit tasks

- ## Unit
#Unit #Task #Concepts #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
lowest level of decomposition in GOMS is the unit task, defined by Card et al. (1983) as a task the user really (consciously) wants to perform

- ## Goal
#Goal #Concepts #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Tasks are triggered by goals and can be further decomposed into subtasks corresponding to intermediary goals.

- ## Operators
#Operators #Concepts #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
actions that in GOMS are termed operators are specified by the methods associated with unit tasks

- ## Operators
#Operators #Concepts #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Operators are cognitive and physical actions the user has to perform in order to accomplish the task goal. Since each operator has an associated execution time (determined experimentally), a GOMS model can help in predicting the time needed to perform a task.

- ## Methods
#Methods #Concepts #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
methods are used to describe how tasks are actually carried out (Fig. 6.2). A method is a sequence of operators that describes task performance

- ## Methods
#Methods #Concepts #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Methods describe how goals are actually accomplished. Higher level methods describe task performance in terms of lower level methods, operators, and selection rules.

- ## Selection
#Selection #Rules #Concepts #GOMS #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
When several methods compete for the same goal, a selection rule is used to choose the proper one.

- ## HTA
#HTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
On the basis of interviews, user observation, and analysis of existing documents (e.g., manuals, documenta- tion), HTA describes tasks in terms of three main concepts (Fig. 6.1): tasks, task hierarchy, and plans.

- ## HTA
#HTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Task models that are primarily intended as support for evaluation and user training, like HTA and GOMS, are not suitable for supporting user interface modeling.

- ## Stopping
#Stopping #Rule #Decomposition #Concepts #HTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
The decomposition stopping criterion is a rule of thumb referred to the p × c rule. This criterion takes into account the probability of a nonsatisfactory performance and the cost of a nonsatisfactory performance (i.e., the consequences it might produce).

- ## Plan
#Plan #Concepts #HTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Since the task hierarchy does not contain any task ordering, any task should be accomplished according to a plan describable in terms of rules, skills, and knowledge. A plan specifies an ordering in which subtasks of a given task could be carried on, thus acting as a constraint on task performance.

- ## Plan
#Plan #Concepts #HTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Plans are very close to textual description or to the activity list (chap. 1) of traditional task analysis. One advantage of plans is that they do not create any artificial tasks, as some formal notations force analysts’ to do to avoid ambiguous specification. On the other hand, because plans are informal, it is not possible to apply automatic checking of properties such as consistency and reachability.

- ## Plan
#Plan #Concepts #HTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Moreover, plans typically describe temporal constraints in a procedural way. Adding new tasks means rewriting the plans associated with the next higher level task, which may be tedious and lead to errors.

- ## Goal
#Goal #Concepts #HTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Any task can be expressed in terms of goals that are reached when the corresponding task is accomplished. Each goal has a status (i.e., latent or active) and conditions to be satisfied.

- ## Goal
#Goal #Concepts #HTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
goals are independent of the concrete means of reaching them. Therefore, for each goal at any level of decomposition, For each goal, several different operations for reaching the goal can be imagined and specified

- ## GTA
#GTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
GroupWare Task Analysis (GTA) was developed by van der Veer, Lenting, and Bergevoet (1996) as a means of modeling the complexity of tasks in a cooperative environment. GTA has roots in ethnography; It is applied to design cooperative systems, and is based on activity theory. It adopts a clear distinction between tasks and actions.

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #GTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
An attractive feature of GTA is its capability of representing cooperative tasks (groupware). The representation is done by integrating the role concept in the task world and enabling representation of tasks sets for which a role is responsible of organizational aspects, such as how a role is assigned to different agents.
