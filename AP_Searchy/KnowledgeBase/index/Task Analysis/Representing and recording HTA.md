It is important to adopt a rational numbering system to keep track of the work. Numbering systems are merely clerical tools and different numbering systems can be devised

Without backup notes, the task analysis is extremely limited. Tables provide a solution to this problem. There are two main issues concerning representing task analysis in a table. First there is the issue of how to represent the hierarchical structure in a linear sequence. Second is the question of what additional information should be provided in the Figure 5.3 This shows both the manner in which goals not further redescribed are underlined and illustrates the numbering system.

Lists are another textual form of representing plans. For example, the following list entails a number of operations carried out at the same time, with other operations contingent upon prior completion of other operations and external conditions. Where plans depend upon interpreting different conditions, this sort of representation can become cluttered.

If a situation is complicated and the procedure is contingent upon different circumstances, then flow charts and rule-sets are effective ways of expressing the plan
