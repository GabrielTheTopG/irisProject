These interviews focus on gaining information about the cognitive strategies used to accomplish the task including situation assessment strategies, identification and interpretation of critical cues,Applied cognitive task analysis 91 metacognitive strategies, important perceptual distinctions, etc.

More procedural or predictable tasks are handled by smart machines, while humans have become responsible for tasks that require inference, diagnoses, judgement, and decision making

Applied Cognitive Task Analysis (ACTA), a set of streamlined cognitive task analysis tools that have been developed specifically for use by professionals who have not been trained in cognitive psychology, but who do develop applications that can benefit from the use of cognitive task analysis.

The task diagram elicits a broad overview of the task and identifies the difficult cognitive elements. Although this preliminary interview offers only a surface-level view of the cognitive elements of the task, it enables the interviewer to focus the more in-depth interviews

- ## Step
#Step #1 #Task #Diagram #Procedure #ACTA #CTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
subject matter expert is asked to decompose the task into steps or subtasks with a question such as, Think about what you do when you (task of interest). Can you break this task down into less than six, but more than three steps?’ The goal is to get the expert to walk through the task in his/her mind, verbalizing major steps.

Of the steps you have just identified which require difficult cognitive skills? By cognitive skills I mean judgements, assessments, problem solving—thinking skills’

knowledge audit identifies ways in which expertise is used in a domain and provides examples based on actual experience

#Step #2 #Knowledge #Audit #Procedure #ACTA #CTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
The knowledge audit is organized around knowledge categories that have been found to characterize expertise. These include; diagnosing and predicting, situation awareness, perceptual skills, developing and knowing when to apply tricks of the trade, improvising, metacognition, recognizing anomalies, and compensating for equipment limitations

#Step #2 #Knowledge #Audit #Procedure #ACTA #CTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
output of the knowledge audit is shown in table 1, which contains an inventory of task-specific expertise. This table includes examples of situations in which experience has been called into play, cues and strategies used in dealing with these difficult situations, and an explanation of why such situations present a challenge to less-experienced operators.

simulation interview is based on presentation of a challenging scenario to the SME. The authors recommend that the interviewer retrieves a scenario that already exists for use in this interview.

- ## Step
#Step #3 #Simulation #Interview #Procedure #ACTA #CTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
After exposure to the simulation, the SME is asked to identify major events, including judgements and decisions, with a question such as, ‘As you experience this simulation, imagine you are the (job you are investigating) in the incident. Afterwards, I am going to ask you a series of questions about how you would think and act in this situation’. Each event is probed for situation assessment, actions, critical cues, and potential errors surrounding that event

The technique can also be used to contrast expert and novice perspectives by conducting interviews with people of differing levels of expertise using the same simulation.

#Step #4 #Definition  #Cognitive #Demands #Table #Procedure #ACTA #CTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
The cognitive demands table is intended to provide a format for the practitioner to use in focusing the analysis on project goals. The authors offer sample headings for the table based on analyses that they have conducted in the past (difficult cognitive element, why difficult, common errors, and cues and strategies used), but recommend that practitioners focus on the types of information that they will need to develop a new course or design a new system
