#QUPER #Prioritizing #QRs #Challenges #NonFunctional #Requirements #Software #Engineering 
The main identified challenge by using QUPER’s benefit view  was difficulties to identify and specify the values for the  differentiation and saturation breakpoints. In addition, different  understanding of the breakpoints value among the involved  stakeholders was raised as a challenge.

The practitioners expressed that there is no need for estimating the  cost and cost barriers for all quality requirements. Instead, only  the quality requirements that are critical and have a major impact  on the entire product need to be modeled in QUPER. No further  elaborations were given on this topic.

Future research includes  the development of how to apply the cost view in industrial  practice. In addition, the practical guidelines need to be  empirically evaluated in an industrial context to ensure  transferability.

Dependencies among quality requirements. Dependencies may have a major impact on the estimated cost for other  features. The cost to improve the quality level for one feature  may imply an improved level of quality for other features
