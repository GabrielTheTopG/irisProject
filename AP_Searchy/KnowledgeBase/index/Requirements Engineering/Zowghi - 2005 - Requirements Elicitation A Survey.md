- ## Goal

high-level goals that represent objectives for the system are decomposed  (e.g. usually using AND and OR relationships) and elaborated (e.g. with “Why”  and “How” questioning) into sub goals and then further refined in such a way that  individual requirements are elicited. The result of this process is significantly  more complicated and complete than the traditional methods of representing sys- tem goals using tree structure diagrams.

#Scenarios #Eliciting #Requirements #Requirements #Engineering 
Scenarios are widely used in requirements elicitation and, as the name suggests,  are narrative and specific descriptions of current and future processes including  actions and interactions between the users and the system. Like use cases, scenar- ios do not typically consider the internal structure of the system, and require an in- cremental and interactive approach to their development

- ## Brainstorming
#Brainstorming #Eliciting #Requirements #Requirements #Engineering 
Brainstorming [50] is a process where participants from different stakeholder  groups engage in informal discussion to rapidly generate as many ideas as possible  without focusing on any one in particular. It is important when conducting this  type of group work to avoid exploring or critiquing ideas in great detail.

Card sorting requires the stakeholders to sort a series of cards containing the  names of domain entities into groups according to their own understanding. Fur- thermore, the stakeholder is required to explain the rationale for the way in which  the cards are sorted. It

Task analysis [9, 53] employs a top-down approach where high-level tasks are de- composed into subtasks and eventually detailed sequences until all actions and  events are described. The primary objectives of this technique is to construct a hi- erarchy of the tasks performed by the users and the system, and determine the  knowledge used or required to carry them out. Task analysis provides information  on the interactions of both the user and the system with respect to the tasks as well  as a contextual description of the activities that take place
