Ad-hoc prioritization: In total for as many as nine out  of eleven case organizations, either both or one of PM and  PL indicate that QR are prioritized in an ad-hoc fashion.  There are different “approaches” at the studied companies of  how QR are prioritized in an ad-hoc fashion: (1) customer  input, (2) marketing department, and (3) “gut feeling” (based  on the practitioners experience). In three case organizations  it is the customer who prioritizes all QR, either direct  (provides a list of prioritized requirements to the developing  company) or indirect (the PM or PL makes a decision, based  on his/her gut feeling/experience, if a particular requirement  may be important to their customers).

The pair-wise comparison technique suggested by  Karlsson [15] is based on the Analytical Hierarchy Process  (AHP) [31]. In this technique, pairs of requirements are  compared according to their importance. The comparisons  provide an understanding of each requirements share of the  total value.

- ## Numerical

Numerical Assignment (Grouping) is, according to  [4], [21], the most traditional and common prioritization  technique. Numerical assignment is based on grouping  requirements into different categories, where three groups  are common in practice [32]. According to [33], using  categories like high, medium, and low may confuse the  stakeholders since different stakeholders may have different  views of what, e.g. high and medium means.

- ## Cumulative

Cumulative voting ($100-Dollar Test) is a  straightforward prioritization technique where stakeholders  are given a fictitious $100 to distribute on requirements

- ## Ranking
#Ranking #Techniques #Prioritizing #FRs #Challenges #Functional #Requirements #Software #Engineering 
Ranking is a technique based on an ordinal scale where  requirements cannot be tied in ranking, which means the  most important requirement is ranked first, and the least  important ranked last, on an ordinal scale.

- ## CostValue

Cost-value approach [16] is a prioritization technique  based on AHP. The cost-value approach uses a two- dimension graph that displays the requirements value  against its cost. AHP is used from a customer and user  perspective to assess the value of each requirement,  followed by an assessment of the requirements cost from an  implementation perspective
