Goal-oriented requirements engineering is concerned with  the use of goals for eliciting, elaborating, structuring, spec-  ifying, analyzing, negotiating, documenting, and modlfjâ€˜ing  requirements. This area has received increasing attention  over the past few years.

The benefit of goal modeling is to support heuristic, qualita-  tive or formal reasoning schemes during requirements engi-  neering (see Section 5). Goals are generally modelled by  intrinsic features such as their type and attributes, and by  their links to other goals and to other elements of a require-  ments model.

- ## Goal

A goal is an objective the system under consideration should  achieve. Goal formulations thus refer to intended properties  to be ensured; they are optative statements as opposed to  indicative ones, and bounded by the subject matter [Jac95,  Zav97al.

a goal graph provides vertical traceability from high-level  strategic concerns to low-level technical details; it allows  evolving versions of the system under consideration to be  integrated as alternatives into one single framework;
