During one step of the ATAM,2 the evaluators  ask the system’s stakeholders to construct a utility  tree. The utility tree has as its leaves a collection of  quality attribute scenarios

Organizing  quality attribute scenarios into a utility tree pro- vides significant coverage of the quality attribute  requirements in a short amount of time.

Utility tree for the building automation system. The letters  represent high, medium, or low priorities for the business and  technical stakeholders, respectively

integrate quality at- tribute scenarios and SEI’s Attribute Driven Design  (ADD)2 with Object-Oriented Analysis and Design  (OOAD)3 to produce a design that supports both  functional and quality attribute concerns

However, most mainstream software design  methodologies5 don’t clearly articulate how to  represent, elicit, and use quality requirements to  create a software architecture.

Integrating architecture-centric methods,  such as ADD, into mainstream software develop- ment methodologies produces significant bene- fits.12,13

prioritiza- tion tuple next to the quality attribute scenario, the  letters represent priorities that are high, medium,  or low. The tuple’s first letter is the priority that the  business stakeholders generated to represent the  quality attribute’s business value. The second letter  is the priority that the technical stakeholders gener- ated to represent the effort required to achieve the  quality attribute

#Specifying #QRs #Challenges #NonFunctional #Requirements #Software #Engineering 
A quality attribute scenario is a quality attribute specific requirement with six  parts: the stimulus, its source, the environment, the  artifact, the response, and the response measure.2 It provides an operational definition for a quality  attribute.
