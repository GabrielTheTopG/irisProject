KAOS [2], which perhaps pioneered in promoting goal-oriented requirements  engineering at least from a functional goal perspective, goals are: “… modelled by  intrinsic features such as their type and attributes, and by their links to other goals and  to other elements of a requirements model.” KAOS addresses both functional goals  and non-functional goals

qual- ity attributes” [4], which is understood as a set of concerns related to the concept of  quality. For a definition of quality, an IEEE standard [5] is used here as a companion:  “Software quality is the degree to which software possesses a desired combination of  attributes (e.g., reliability, interoperability).”

important piece of work on NFRs is the NFR Framework [1] [3], which de- couples the concept of functionality from other quality attributes and concerns for  productivity, time and cost, by means of a higher-level of abstraction.
