could quantify the requirement “The response  time must be fast” as “The response time shall be  less than 0.5 seconds in 98 percent of all user input  actions.” Work on quantification was pioneered by  Barry Boehm1 and Tom Gilb,2

So, the disadvantage of quantifying quality  requirements is equally obvious: it can be time- consuming and expensive. Dogmatically applying  the rule “You shall quantify all quality require- ments” might thus result in huge, unjustified re- quirement costs.

Consequently, we should replace the rule “You  shall quantify all quality requirements” with “A  quality requirement should be represented such that  it delivers optimum value.”

- ## Measuring

we must assess how every quality re- quirement should be represented so that it delivers  the most value.

qualitatively stated quality require- ment such as “The new data entry function shall  be recoverable” can suffice to achieve the value— that is, that the client is satisfied with the recovery  features he gets for the new function

Giving up full quantification implies giving up  this form of verification. The right-hand column of  table 1 lists the verification techniques to be applied  in different situations.

A partially quantified quality requirement  is verified by a combination of inspection and  measurement.
