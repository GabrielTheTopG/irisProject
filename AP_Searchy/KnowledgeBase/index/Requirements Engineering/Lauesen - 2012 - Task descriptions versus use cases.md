The study shows that with use cases, the customer’s present problems disappear unless the analyst can see a solution to the problem. The consequence is that when the customer looks for a new system, he will not take into account how well the new system deals with the problems. Even if the analyst has specified a solution, a better solu- tion may not get the merit it deserves because the corre- sponding problem is not visible in the use cases. Task descriptions avoid this by allowing the analyst to state a problem as one of the ‘‘steps,’’ with the implicit requirement that a solution is wanted (a problem require- ment). Example solutions may be stated, but they are just examples—not requirements. In practice, stakeholders need some guidance to understand these principles.

Often the dialog would be very inconvenient if imple- mented as described. (2) Many use case templates provide fields for rules, preconditions, etc., and these fields encourage analysts to invent rules, etc. Often the rules do not reflect a customer need and may even be harmful

Task descriptions do not specify a dialog but only what user and system need to do together. The supplier defines the solution and the dialog, and stakeholders can compare the solution against the task steps to be supported. Tasks do not tempt the analyst with fields for rules, etc. When rules are needed, the analyst must specify them as separate task steps or in other sections of the requirements.
