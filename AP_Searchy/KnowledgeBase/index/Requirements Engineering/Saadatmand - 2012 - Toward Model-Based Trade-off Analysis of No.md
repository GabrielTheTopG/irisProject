According to the IEEE standards, 610.12-1990 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 24765:2010(E) [12], [13], the following definitions is provided for non-functional requirements: “a software requirement that describes not what the software will do but how the software will do it (i.e., design constraints)”

However, this may also imply that our suggested approach can be especially more applicable for component-based systems 148where systems are built out of already existing components and thus more knowledge about their characteristics and behaviors are available (e.g., memory usage, execution time)
