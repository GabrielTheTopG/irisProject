Goal Centric Traceability (GCT) non-functional requirements and their interdependencies are modeled as softgoals in a Softgoal Interdependency Graph (SIG).

To understand these tradeoffs, the subgoals are decomposed into 'operationalizations', which provide candidate design solutions for achieving the goal and provide the basis for reasoning about potential tradeoffs.
