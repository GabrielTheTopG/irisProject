functional requirement of a system  expresses that › a system offers a particular  functional feature such that it  can be used for a certain purpose  (use case),

nonbehavioral properties of sys- tems, including the syntactic represen- tation of systems or quality attributes  such as readability of code.

captured and expressed in system  interface behavior terms, and they can  be classified as functional properties  because they address aspects of func- tionality. The fifth property is nonbe- havioral and also nonfunctional.

As a consequence of  considering probabilistic interface  behavior as addressed by the func- tional requirements, many of the  classic quality properties are covered  by functional requirements.

Requirements categorization aims to  distinguish between behavioral and  nonbehavioral aspects, and behavioral  aspects have a significant impact on  system design. Formally, they are cap- tured by nondeterministic and proba- bilistic models of external (interface)  and internal views.

nonfunctional. The latter  are divided into quality requirements versus process con- straints or product constraints—categories that are often  vaguely defined. Categorization based on functional and  architectural views in terms of logical (as in set theory)  and probabilistic behavior models should help mitigate  these weaknesses and defects.
