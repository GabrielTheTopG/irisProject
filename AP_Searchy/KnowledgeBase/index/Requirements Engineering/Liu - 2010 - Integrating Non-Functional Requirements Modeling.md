#Definitions #NonFunctional #Requirements #Software #Engineering 
Functional requirements (FR) can be realized as  functional entities quite straighttorwardly. Non-functional  requirements (NFR), on the contrary, are typically not as  straightforwardly as the FRs. Some NFRs might be realized  as functional entities whereas others might be manifested as  goals or constraints placed on the design [3][4]. Therefore,  NFRs may impact both the structural and behavioral aspects  of the design model.

This process is mainly inspired by  two pioneer work, one is the NFR framework proposed by  Chllllg et al [3]; the other is the usecase driven software  development method [9].

In qualitative approaches, the NFR framework [3] is an  early and representative work. It treats NFRs as potentially  conflicting or synergistic softgoals to be achieved,

M.Kassab et al [17] propose an ontology-based approach  to NFR conceptualization, using it to assess non-functional  requirement size, trace NFR and estimate early software  effort estimation. L. Chung et al [18] propose a framework  for representing and integrating NFRs with FRs in the  usecase model at some association points. Sam Supakkul et  al [19] propose an integrating modeling language by  extending lTh.1L with the NFR Framework. However, these  works are primarily focusing on the representation, while our  approach is paying close attention to support the process of  identifying and modeling NFRs' impacts to U1\.1L design  models.

Most of the existing related works are focus on  quantitative approaches, which aim to support the analysis or  validation of NFRs in the time- and resource-critical  applications. Vittorio Cortellessa et al [10] propose a Non- Functional MDA framework (NFMDA)
