metrics for quality requirements, two  approaches with similar characteristics are identified for  quantification of quality requirements. Both approaches  suggest quantifying quality requirements by an interval.  However, Olsson et al. found that a Min-Max interval is the  least used scale for quantifying quality requirements in  industry, while an absolute value is the most common  quantification.

Davis et al. [5] found that interviews are the most  effective elicitation technique for gathering requirements. In  this systematic review, three of five techniques use  interviews to elicit quality requirements. Moreover, Davis et  al. [5] found that interviews are the most commonly used  elicitation technique, which is only partly confirmed in this  study

Doerr et al. [18] argue that  elicitation of quality and functional requirements need to be  intertwined with architecture. On the other hand, Cysneiros  and Leite [17] argue that quality and functional requirements  should not be dealt within the same scope

no study has been  conducted on how to estimate the cost of quality  requirements. To the best of our knowledge, based on our  SLR and the previous systematic reviews on cost estimations  [10], we believe that there is a lack of evidence of how cost  estimations of quality requirements are conducted

Prioritization of quality requirements warrants  further attention. Not a single study looked into  techniques of prioritization of quality requirements

empirical evidence shows that  different stakeholders have different views with regards to  important quality requirements,
