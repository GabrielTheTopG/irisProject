According to the best knowledge, no systematic  approach and steps are introduced for linking FRs and  NFRs for software evolution via software architecture  style. In [37, 38, 39] it can be seen that NFRs are just  added into the detailed model, and there approaches do  not consider the relationships among NFRs, FRs and  architecture style.
