Goal-driven approaches have proved to be an effective way to elicit require- ments [64, 76] and also to support a systematic exploration of design choices [41,  74, 90] to check requirements completeness [91], to ensure requirements pre- traceability [26, 66] and to help in the detection of threats [31] such as conflicts  [68] and obstacles [41, 64] and their resolution

According to Axel van Lamsweerde [43] “a goal corresponds to an objective the  system should achieve through the cooperation of agents in the software to be and  in the environment”. Goals refer to intended or optative [32] properties of envi- sioned system or of its environment

Another dis- tinction often made in the literature is between soft goals, whose satisfaction can- not be established in a clear-cut sense [57], and hard goals whose satisfaction can  be established through verification techniques [7, 11, 16].

Finding the right goal: It is often assumed that systems are constructed with  some goals in mind [18]. However, practical experiences show that goals are  not given and therefore, the question of where they originate from [2] acquires  importance

Goals bridge the gap between organizational strategies and system require- ments thus providing a conceptual link between the system and its organiza- tional context
