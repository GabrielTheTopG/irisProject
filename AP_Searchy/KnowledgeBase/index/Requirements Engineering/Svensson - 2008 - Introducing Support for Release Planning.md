Karlsson and Ryan [8] suggested using a cost-value  approach for requirements prioritization based on the  AHP [14].

The QUPER model is based on the observations  that quality is continuous and non-linear. The quality  level is typically not viewed as either good or bad, but  rather as something with different shades of goodness  on a sliding scale. In addition, we assume that a change  in quality level may result in non-linear changes to  both cost and benefit, and that this non-linearity is of  interest to release planning and roadmapping

This paper presents one case of QUPER tailoring,  implementation, and most important evaluation,  conducted at Sony Ericsson, one of the leading mobile  handset developers.

The third challenge was how to specify  performance requirements that are quantifiable,  representative of the “real world”, and under what  conditions they should be fulfilled.
