Requirements statements (R) describe a desired state of the application domain once a system has been introduced— that is, what needs to happen

Specification statements (S) describe how a system will re- spond to external stimuli— what the system does.

Domain statements (or facts) describe proper- ties of the application environment that are true independently of the new system. They also provide part of the glue that forms the rationale for particular specification statements.

Satisfaction arguments link specification statements, domain statements, and requirement statements with an explicit rationale. They force the requirements engineer to explain the thinking that underpins a specification decision, with two key benefits:

■ Design thinking is exposed, making reviews of requirements documentation more effective. ■ When future change occurs, the original design thinking is more likely to be considered.

Satisfaction arguments provide a means of implementing rich traceability1 and are analogous to the use of techniques such as goal-structuring notation2 to record safety arguments in support of safety cases.
