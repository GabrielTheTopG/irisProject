DIANE method has been created to solve malfunctions in the use of interac- tive software, leading to trouble in the information system and difficulties in the  user learning and memorisation. The DIANE method [Barthet88] aims to integrate  the user and his interaction capability into the current process of designing an in- teractive software.

According to the Seeheim model [Pfaff85], the Diane method, based on the analy- sis of tasks and users (aims, decision margin, experience), brings a model and for- malism to describe the dialogue control and its interfacing with the core applica- tion.

- ## Diane
#Diane #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
first version, DIANE did not include explicit links with objects. This lack was  a major disadvantage for the graphic user interface design

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #Diane+ #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
DIANE+ extends the DIANE method to make possible the automatic genera- tion of user interface. This extension concerns the model of dialogue control, and  the integration of an OPAC object data model extending the PAC model

- ## Characteristics

DIANE+ method [Tarby93], which allows us to specify human- computer dialogue.

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #Diane+ #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
DIANE+ [Tarby93] extends the DIANE method to make possible the automatic  generation and the automatic management of the user interface. These extensions  concern the model of dialogue control and the integration of an object data model  called OPAC (sub-section 2.6).

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #Diane+ #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
DIANE+ method covers the specification phase of an interactive application; it  makes possible to integrate the results of the analysis phase and can be used during  the phases of analysis and specification as a formalism to describe an interactive  application

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #Diane+ #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Conceptual Representation covers the concept of utility [Se- nach90].

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #Diane+ #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
user's viewpoint, called External Representation, corresponds to the software as it  will be seen and operated by the user. This External Representation is made of two  main parts; the first one translates the elements of the Conceptual Representation  involved in the man-machine interaction; the second one takes into account all the  specific elements of the External Representation

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #Diane+ #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
DIANE+ is both task oriented and user oriented. It uses the user's logics through a  task analysis which will become executable [Copas94], but it does not distinguish  kinds of tasks and goals such as interface goals or social goals [Gilmore95]

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #Diane+ #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
DIANE+ uses both the concepts of tasks and objects like [Rosson95] as opposite  of [Benyon95] which mainly uses the concept of data as support of task descrip- tion.

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #Diane+ #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
main advantage of DIANE+ is the merging between a human factor approach  and a software engineering design method, resulting in the adaptation of the design  method formalism and the integration of characteristics of users and tasks.

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #Diane+ #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
largest flexibility to the users with a perfect consistency in regard to the man- agement rules of the organisation. This advantage is really relevant in a context of  preplanified or procedural tasks with organisational constraints

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #Diane+ #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
The current version of DIANE+ does not perform the ergonomic evaluation of a  software, but DIANE+ has already been applied to the prior evaluation of an appli- cation in the field of air traffic control [Zorola95]

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #Diane+ #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
to integrate the human factors into the design of an interactive applica- tion, the DIANE+ method proposes a model of the interactive application includ- ing three viewpoints: the analyst's, the user's and the programmer's viewpoint

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #Diane+ #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
analyst's viewpoint, called Conceptual Representation, describes for a workstation,  first the general logics of the new information system, then the logics of the inter- active processing

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #Diane+ #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
programmer's viewpoint, called Internal Representation, corresponds to the im- plementation of both Conceptual and External Representations. No new user  specification is generated during this phase

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #Diane+ #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Cognitive ergonomics and the various representations of  an interactive application

- ## Abstraction
#Abstraction #Level #Diane+ #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
highest abstraction level includes the goals of the application and provides the  most general view of its objectives. In fact, these goals are split up into sub-goals,  sub-sub-goals, etc., corresponding to lower abstraction levels

- ## Abstraction
#Abstraction #Level #Diane+ #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
The more extended the splitting is, the more accu- rate the description of man-machine dialogue is

- ## AIms
#AIms  #User's #Logics #Diane+ #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
identifying the aims of the vari- ous users is the starting point of the method. The aims reflect the functions that  the organisation assigns to the workstations

- ## AIms
#AIms  #User's #Logics #Diane+ #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
for each aim, the user's logics is defined separately from the technical logics.  In the case of preplanified or procedural tasks, this user's logics results in various  procedures leading to the aim

- ## Dialogue
#Dialogue #Control #between #Man  #Machine #Diane+ #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Who triggers an operation? The triggering is optional when it is the user, and  automatic when it is the computer

- ## Dialogue
#Dialogue #Control #between #Man  #Machine #Diane+ #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Who performs an operation? The operation is manual if it is the user, (e.g.,  sign a document), automatic if it is the computer (e.g., disconnect), and interactive if it is both (e.g., enter a name).

- ## Dialogue
#Dialogue #Control #between #Man  #Machine #Diane+ #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Who checks the performing of an operation? The operation is optional when  the user checks, and required when the computer checks

- ## Dialogue

Who controls the sequence of operations? The precedence is indicative if the  user controls the sequence and permanent if it is the computer.

- ## Adaptation
#Adaptation  #Dialogue #to #Users #Diane+ #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
detailed representation  through the operations. For this stage, we use procedures which are formal and de- tailed descriptions of the manner to realise an aim

- ## Adaptation
#Adaptation  #Dialogue #to #Users #Diane+ #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Adaptation of the man-machine dialogue to various kinds of users

- ## Adaptation
#Adaptation  #Dialogue #to #Users #Diane+ #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
For each goal, we describe first the forecast procedure which results "naturally"  from interviews and questionnaires essentially with persons who are responsible  for carrying out the procedure

- ## Adaptation
#Adaptation  #Dialogue #to #Users #Diane+ #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Effective procedures reflect real activity "in situ" or during simulations. To de- scribe effective procedures corresponding to particular cases or to different work  habits, it is necessary either to interview users more thoroughly

- ## Adaptation
#Adaptation  #Dialogue #to #Users #Diane+ #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Interviews cannot highlight spontaneously the minimal procedure which includes  information generally not explicit. The point is to define explicitly the decision  margin allowed to the users to do the work assigned to the station

- ## OPAC
#OPAC #Data #Model #Diane+ #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
The current version of DIANE+ incorporates an object-oriented data  model called OPAC2  [Tarby93] derived from the PAC3  model [Coutaz88].

- ## OPAC
#OPAC #Data #Model #Diane+ #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
OPAC model structures data into elementary or compounded classes whom  instances are capable of providing and managing their external and internal repre- sentations

- ## OPAC
#OPAC #Data #Model #Diane+ #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
OPAC model provides a set of OPAC classes. These classes are specified once  for all by the designer.

- ## Notation
#Notation #Diane+ #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
DIANE+ uses a formalism (figure 4) created to minimise the designing work on the  two following points:

- ## Notation
#Notation #Diane+ #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
The DIANE+ formalism

- ## Notation
#Notation #Diane+ #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
When an operation is split into sub-operations, it is possible to apply constraints on  this operation beside its sub-operations.

- ## Notation
#Notation #Diane+ #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Any operation may have a personal constraint which concerns its number of re- quired executions

- ## Notation
#Notation #Diane+ #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
DIANE+ can represent all the constraints of the above specifications.  All the algorithmic structures do exist in DIANE+.

In XUAN, the temporal constraints are more powerful than in DIANE+ which is  explicit for the start of operations but not with the end of operation.

- ## MERISE
