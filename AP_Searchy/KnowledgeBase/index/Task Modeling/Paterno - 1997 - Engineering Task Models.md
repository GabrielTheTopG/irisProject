- ## Purpose
#Purpose #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
A task model describes a set of activities which the user  can perform to reach goals in a specific application  domain. A goal is a desired modification of the state of a  system or a query to it.

- ## Tasks
#Tasks #Terminology #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Type: there are four possible types: abstract, user,  application, interaction

- ## Tasks

Subtask 03 name of father task

- ## Tasks
#Tasks #Terminology #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Objects: vector of objects, each element defines: name of  the object, type of the object (internal, perceivable), list of  input object actions, list of output object actions

- ## Tasks

Iteration: a Boolean indicating whether the task is iterative

First action: The set of the possible initial actions is  indicated

Last action: The set of the possible final actions is  indicated

user tasks are completely performed by the user, they  require cognitive or physical activities without  interacting with the system.

application tasks are completely executed by the  system. They receive information from the system  and they can supply information to the user

interaction tasks are performed by user interactions  with the system

abstract tasks are tasks which require complex  actions, though how to allocate their performance has  not yet been decided.

processing tasks, given an input they perform some  processing and then provide a related result;

control task, their main purpose is to generate an  event control: they inform other tasks that a given  condition has been reached.

- ## Actions
#Actions #Terminology #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Actions are associated with objects. Actions can be  cognitive, logical or physical

- ## Objects
#Objects #Terminology #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Objects are entities which are manipulated to perform  tasks by the associated actions. The objects are user-  perceivable and internal objects, which are both  manipulated to perform the tasks by using the associated  actions.

- ## Objects
#Objects #Terminology #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Perceivable objects are items which users can interact with  using their senses, for example menus, icons, windows,  voice, sounds, and so on. They can belong to either  application or interaction tasks.

- ## Objects
#Objects #Terminology #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Internal objects are entities which belong to the  application and which need to be mapped onto perceivable  objects to be presented to the user. Examples of internal  objects are: the state of a request for a data base, the data  base itself.

- ## Objects
#Objects #Terminology #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Each object can belong to one or more tasks

- ## Operators
#Operators #Terminology #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
The temporal relationships among tasks are expressed  by using ConcurTaskTrees [9] a graphicaI concurrent  notation which allows designers to structure hierarchically  the possible tasks and indicate the temporal relationships

- ## Elicitation
#Elicitation #Methods  #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
task model is built in three phases:  a hierarchical logical decomposition of. the tasks  represented by a tree-like structure;  an identification of the temporal relationships among  tasks;  an identification of the objects associated with each  task.
