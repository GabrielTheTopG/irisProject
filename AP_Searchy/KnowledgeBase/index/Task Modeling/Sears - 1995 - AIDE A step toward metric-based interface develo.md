- ## Adept
#Adept #Interactive #System #Design #Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
A system called ADEPT combines task and user modeling with a rapid prototyping tool [5]. ADEPT allows designers to edit the user and task models and generate interface models that can be converted to use any predefine set of interface widgets. ADEPT does not evaluate interfaces, but does incorporate both user and task information into the design process.

- ## USAGE
#USAGE #UserInterface #Design #Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
USAGE, has combined the benefits of a user interface design environment (UIDE) and a formal method for analyzing interfaces (GOMS) [1].

- ## USAGE
#USAGE #UserInterface #Design #Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
USAGE reads this file and translates it into a GOMS model that is used to predict task completion times for the interface.

- ## AIDE
#AIDE #UserInterface #Evaluation #& #Simulation #Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
AIDE (semi-Automated Interface Designer and Evaluator) which assists designers in creating and evaluating layouts for a given set of interface controls.
