approach is mainly based on a comparison of planned user behaviour and actual  user behaviour [13]. Information about the planned logical behaviour of the user is  contained in a (previously developed) task model, which describes how the tasks  should be performed according to the current design and implementation

CTT [14] task models are used to describe it  by their graphical representation of the hierarchical logical structure of the potential  activities along with specification of temporal and semantic relations among tasks.

automatic analysis of the actual user behaviour identified by  the sequences of actions in the logs against the possible expected behaviours  described by the task model there is a preparation phase. In this phase the possible log  actions are associated with the corresponding basic tasks

The core of the logging  tool is the Mobile Logger, which is in an intermediate position between the  application to be evaluated and MultiDevice RemUsine

The task of tracking the activity of the user is carried out by a procedure that is  executed by the application evaluated, which uses libraries included in the operating  system to detect events, and which exploits an inter-process communication model  based on exchanges of messages.
