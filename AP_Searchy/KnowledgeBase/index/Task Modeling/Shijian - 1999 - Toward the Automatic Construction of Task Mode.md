Sequence diagrams show  interactions arranged in time sequence, i.e., the messages that objects exchange are  arranged in time sequence. Collaboration diagrams show interactions organised  around the objects, and relationships amongst objects.

For instance, composite tasks in a task model, such as a Diane+ model, have  task attributes explicitly defined (refer to Table 1). This is not the case for use cases.

Explicitly defined attributes - In UML, the name and textual description are  explicitly represented for a use case;

Implicitly defined attributes - Although not explicitly defined, one can  determine whether the task is manual, automatic, or interactive

Unrepresented attributes - Some information required to construct task  models is difficult if not impossible to extract automatically from a UML  use case. Examples include task preconditions and feedback.

A use case is semantically equivalent to a composite task, and sequence diagrams  are used to elaborate use cases

difference between sequence diagrams and task models is that messages in  sequence diagrams do not explicitly specify all the task attributes present in task  models.

sequence diagrams are roughly equivalent to composite tasks in a task  model;

messages between objects in a sequence diagram are roughly equivalent to  elementary tasks;

Diane+ (Tarby and Barthet, 1996) as our task model formalism. It is a  typical task model formalism in that it allows for the representation of hierarchically  structured tasks and provides a variety of procedural annotations for these tasks

This paper presents a practical approach for augmenting information contained in  00 diagrams in order to construct coherent task models.

This model is  displayed using a task model editor (T AMOT), which we built in JAVA.

The names of elementary tasks - The displayed name of an elementary task  depends on whether its corresponding message is the user or not

The number of elementary tasks - The number of elementary tasks that get  created in the task model is determined by the filter heuristics

Task preconditions and feedback - As discussed earlier, it is difficult to  automatically derive task preconditions and feedback from the textual  comments

Task models are increasingly used for a variety of purposes, but constructing them  remains a difficult task. In this paper, we presented a practical way of automatically  acquiring task models from system behaviour models defined by object-oriented  diagrams
