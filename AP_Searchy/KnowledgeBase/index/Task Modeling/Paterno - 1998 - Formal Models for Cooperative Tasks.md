We define a cooperative task as a task that requires activities from two or more users for its performance

in a cooperative environment, all the activities performed by the users obviously aim to eventually achieve the global goals

develop and analyse a cooperative task model we can follow two main approaches:• a top-down approach, in which —starting from the overall activity of the system— we should derive the activities of the single roles and in what extent every role contributes to carry out the general activity • a bottom-up approach, where the first analysis of every role's activity with the consequent initial task allocation helps to achieve a more modular comprehension of the overall behaviour in the cooperative application.

ConcurTaskTrees [11] is a notation that supplies a hierarchical graphical notation providing a precise semantics for describing concurrent task models of every role

cooperative aspects there are at least three solutions:

monolithic solution, to develop directly one global task model including cooperative and single users tasks

graph-oriented solution, to join together the task tree of each role involved in a single structure in which any co-related actions or sub-tas

additional cooperative task solution, to add another tree (the Co-operative tree) which shows the temporal relationship between tasks belonging to different users

leaves of the cooperative task tree can be either basic or high level tasks in the tree of the related user. In the first case, leaves in the cooperative tree remain leaves in the trees of the related users, whereas in the latter case the leaves in the cooperative tree will be further decomposed in the tree of the related user.

allow designers to specify the following information: task name, roles of users involved, names of the sub-tasks which have to be performed by each type of user, type of communication protocol (for example, synchronous, asynchronous and broadcast), roles cardinality, the media used to interact and communicate, the logical objects that the task needs

This is a limitation for many approaches to task modelling, apart a few exceptions such as GTA [13].
