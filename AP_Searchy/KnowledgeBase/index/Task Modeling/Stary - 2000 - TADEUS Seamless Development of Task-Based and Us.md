Task analysis/design/end user systems (TADEUS) [41] is an approach that intends to enable seamless development support. It addresses domain experts, users, analysts, designers, usability engineers, and programmers. It focuses on representation in the tradition of “containers of ideas” [4, p. 120], facilitates the process of design, the specification and generation of results, and finally, makes the process of development easily accessible

ADEPT project [21], [47], several models have been identified, namely, for task definitions, the specification of user properties and the user interface.

in contrast to TADEUS, the ADEPT user model does not contain access and manipulation permits for elements of the data according to the relationships between tasks and user roles

ADEPT, a top-down design and prototyping approach has been implemented for development: After task analysis (leading to a task model capturing existing tasks), a description of the process the users would like follow when interactively supported has to be elicited (leading to an envisioned task model). The procedure concludes with a detailed specification of the user interface for the envisioned tasks, termed the abstract interface model

The concepts behind the task analysis/design/end users systems (TADEUS) approach to enable seamless development based on end user tasks are a semantically rich representation scheme, a model-driven development procedure, a diagrammatic notation and unifying specification scheme

For user-interface prototyping the TADEUS environment contains a model interpreter that executes structure and behavior speci- fications

TADEUS there is no difference between envi- sioned and existing task representations, since multiple designs might be created in the course of development. In TADEUS both, existing task models and visions about the future of task accomplishment can be handled through versioning of (appli- cation) models

TADEUS [41] targets a comprehensive development method- ology, unifying and diagrammatic (re)presentation of develop- ment knowledge, and the execution of this knowledge to gen- erate user interfaces or portals.

The DEUS ask nalysis and epresentation technique (TATAR) [42] considers analysis not only to be an analysis of work organizations and business processes, but also an analysis of social settings, contents, proposals for reorganizing work, skill requirements and individual profiles

seamless developmentsolution, allowing developers to successively transform user and task inputs into a technical artifact in a way, that 1) all relevant tasks and user properties can be captured (taking into account organizational and cognitive constraints) and 2) it can be traced by actual users (task performers) and (system) developers how the artifact has been created through stepwise refinement and transformation of task knowledge.

defines usability engineering through an in- tegrated model-driven, task-based, user-oriented and object-ori- ented life cycle. As such, it corresponds closer to the actual de- sign process, namely, switching between views, without loss of consistency and completeness of workflow knowledge

However, neither the Waterfall [40] nor the Spiral model [5] for software development has been designed for interactive systems engineering. Thus, both do not actively support the de- velopment of interactive systems based on task or user represen- tations

key features for task-based and user-cen- tered support mechanisms are continuous support of develop- ment phases, starting out with analyzing the work situation of users and their profiles, and a “language” both developers and users understand

Task-based development takes into account the organiza- tional and business context of interactive software sys- tems. Tasks are those entities that have to be supported from the structural point of view as well from the dynamic perspective, i.e., the accomplishment of problem-solving activities
