- ## Purpose
#Purpose #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
The purpose of task modelling is to build a model which describes precisely the relationships among the various tasks identified. These relationships can be of various types, such as temporal and semantic relationships.

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Task models describe how activities can be performed to reach the users’ goals when interacting with the application considered. They should incorporate the2 requirements foreseen by all those who should be taken into consideration when designing an interactive application (designers, software developers, application domain experts, end users, and managers).

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
capture what the possible intentions of the users are and describe logically the activities that should be performed to reach their goals. These models also allow designers to develop an integrated description of both functional and interactive aspects thus improving traditional software engineering approaches which mainly focused on functional aspects.

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
effectively complement the support given by object-oriented approaches, such as UML [8], in interactive software system design. UML is more suitable to model the internal part of an interactive software system whereas task models are more effective to indicate the activities

- ## Scenarios
#Scenarios #Terminology #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
a scenario indicates only one specific sequence of occurrences of the possible activities while the task model should indicate a wide set of activities and the related temporal relationships;

- ## Types
#Types  #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
the system task model, describing how the current system implementation assumes that tasks should be performed;

- ## Types
#Types  #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
the envisioned task model, where designers think about a new system and how users should interact with them;

- ## Types
#Types  #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
the user task model, how users think that tasks should be performed in order to reach their goals

- ## InspectionBased
#InspectionBased #Elicitation #Methods  #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
inspection-based assessment, where some expert evaluates the system or some representation of it, according to a set of criteria;

- ## ModelBased
#ModelBased #Elicitation #Methods  #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
model-based approaches, where a significant model related to the interactive application is used to drive the evaluation;

- ## Empirical
#Empirical #Elicitation #Methods  #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
empirical testing, where direct use of the system is considered.

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #ConcurTaskTrees #CTT #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
supporting engineering approaches to task modelling. It provides a rich set of operators to describe the temporal relationships among tasks (enabling, concurrency, disabling, interruption, optionality). In addition, for each task further information can be given such as its type, the category (indicating how the performance is allocated), the objects that it requires to be manipulated and attributes

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #ConcurTaskTrees #CTT #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Focus on activities: it allows designers to concentrate on the activities that users aim to perform, that are the most relevant aspects when designing interactive applications

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #ConcurTaskTrees #CTT #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
hierarchical structure of this specification has two advantages: it provides a wide range of granularity, allowing large and small task structures to be reused, and it enables reusable task structures

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #ConcurTaskTrees #CTT #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Graphical syntax: a graphical syntax often (though not always) is more easy to interpret, in this case it reflects the logical structure so it has a tree-like form.

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #ConcurTaskTrees #CTT #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Concurrent notation: a rich set of possible temporal relationships among the tasks can be defined. This sort of aspect is usually implicit, expressed informally

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #ConcurTaskTrees #CTT #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Task allocation, how the performance of the task is allocated is indicated by the related category

- ## Cooperative
#Cooperative #ConcurTaskTrees #CCTT #ConcurTaskTrees #CTT #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
cooperative part is described in a manner similar to the single user parts: it is a hierarchical structure with indications of the temporal operators. The main difference is that it includes cooperative tasks: those tasks that imply actions by two or more users in order to be performed

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #GOMS #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods, Selection rules)

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #GOMS #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
based on a cognitive model (the Human Processor Model) which is described by a set of memories and processors and a set of principles underlying their behaviour

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #GOMS #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Dependencies between activities are represented as lines connecting the boxes.

- ## Limitations
#Limitations #GOMS #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
limitation of GOMS approaches is that it considers error-free behaviour and only sequential tasks.

- ## Methods
#Methods #Components #GOMS #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Methods are sequences of subgoals and operators used to structure the description of how to reach a given goal. The selection rules indicate when to use a method instead of another one

- ## CPMGOMS
#CPMGOMS #GOMS #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
CPM-GOMS [15].

- ## CPMGOMS
#CPMGOMS #GOMS #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
CPM- GOMS separate sequences are constructed for each category of operators (cognitive, perceptual, and motor operators are considered)

- ## KLM
#KLM #GOMS #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Keystroke-Level Model (KLM). KLM uses only keystroke- level operators, no goals, methods or selection rules. The analysis simply lists the keystrokes, mouse-movements, and mouse-button presses that a user must perform to accomplish a task, then uses a few simple heuristics to place a single type of coarse “mental operator” which approximates many kinds of internal cognitive actions

Markopoulos [22] provides an example of how this notation has been used to specify task models

- ## UAN
#UAN #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
structure can be found in grammar based approaches to the specification of task models such as in TAG (Task Action Grammar) [30] and ETAG (Extended Task Action Grammar) [35].

- ## UAN
#UAN #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
one part describes task decomposition and the temporal relationships among asynchronous tasks; • the other part associates each basic task with one table. These tables have three columns indicating the user actions, the system feedback and the state modifications requested to perform it.

- ## UAN
#UAN #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
good support for specifying low level actions sequencing. One of the possible limitations is that it can lead to large specifications sometimes with many details not always useful for the designer

- ## UAN
#UAN #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Another limitation is that the order which has to be followed to interpret the tables of the basic tasks (left-to-right) can be rigid and inadequate

Analysing and evaluating usability of an interactive systems: task models can be useful in various ways to support the usability evaluation of an interactive application. They have been used to predict the users’ performance in reaching their goals or to support analysis of user behaviour to identify usability problems.

- ## Applications
#Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Supporting the user during a session: creating a correspondence between tasks and the interaction objects composing the user interface can be useful also at run- time, for example to provide context-sensitive, task-oriented help systems

#UIDE #USAGE #UserInterface #Design #Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
UIDE [13] are analysed by the NGOMSL approach (one of the GOMS family). However this information is still limited with respect to that contained in the logs of the user actions performed during work sessions by users. More interesting results can be obtained using task models and empirical information. In [20] there is a description of how to use task models to support usability evaluation

- ## Task

Thus, there is a strong need for engineered tools able to support task modelling of applications, including cooperative and multi-user ones which are on the rise, and the analysis of such models’ contents which may can be complex in the case of many real applications. Euterpe [37] is an example of tool for groupware task analysis based on an ontology for task models

- ## Task
#Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Task analysis can be obtained using different techniques: • interviews or workshops; • questionnaires; • observing users in their work place; • considering how activities are performed in the current environment; • considering existing documentation and training methods.
