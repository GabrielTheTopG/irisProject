The user task model specifies  what the user does, or wants to do, and why

early work of Breedvelt, [1], we will use  patterns as a medium to describe reusable fragments for  the creation of several models

Pattern Supported Approach [7] has also  demonstrated the applicability of patterns in the abstract  and concrete phases of UI development

patterns have the potential to inherently  promote the reuse of ideas and knowledge

task pattern that is particularly often applicable is  Search [16]. The pattern is applicable in interactive  applications that manage considerable amounts of data,  which can be accessed by the user

order to model task patterns in a usable manner, the  Task Pattern Markup Language (TPML) has been  developed.

#Task #Patterns #Task #Reusability  #Extensibility #Characteristics  #Notations #Notations  #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
TPML consists of five descriptor elements (Name, Problem, Context, Solution and  Rational) and the pattern body containing the formalized  solution.

We have also seen  patterns for writing patterns, and patterns for writing  pattern languages [10]

For example, Zimmer [21] divides the relationships  between the patterns of Gamma catalog [5] into 3 types:  “X is similar to y”, “X uses Y”, and “Variants of X uses  Y”.

- ## Intrinsic
#Intrinsic #pattern #information #Task #Patterns #Task #Reusability  #Extensibility #Characteristics  #Notations #Notations  #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
intrinsic information, is made up of  the information and analysis about each pattern  independently. Patterns are meant to encapsulate relevant  knowledge inside them

- ## Intrinsic
#Intrinsic #pattern #information #Task #Patterns #Task #Reusability  #Extensibility #Characteristics  #Notations #Notations  #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
mportance of this  knowledge lies in understanding the pattern and  processing it into a useful artifact.

- ## Extrinsic
#Extrinsic #pattern #information #Task #Patterns #Task #Reusability  #Extensibility #Characteristics  #Notations #Notations  #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
extrinsic information, which is  knowledge about how a pattern relates to other patterns,  and what the types and implications of these relationships  are. This information does not relate to each pattern in  isolation, but to the way in which a pattern interacts with  other patterns.

Experts assume that part of this knowledge is simply  “common sense” and hence they don’t bother writing it  down. Users, especially novice ones, often don’t have this  knowledge

- ## Assimilation
#Assimilation #pattern #information #Task #Patterns #Task #Reusability  #Extensibility #Characteristics  #Notations #Notations  #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
assimilation information,  which is information about when, where, and how to  apply a pattern in an integrated design process.

This part  concentrates mainly on the final phases of a design,  where more information about the context and the  environment is available.

Tacit  knowledge is a source of confusion in pattern reuse

Traetteberg [20] mentions that the role of representing  knowledge is both to capture knowledge, and to support  the design process

work  of Nonaka [13] to distinguish between tacit and explicit  knowledge and suggests 4 modes of knowledge transfer:

Internalization (creating tacit knowledge by acting  upon explicit knowledge)
