presented both the task and system  models of two design iterations of an interactive cockpit  application. These models have been analyzed in order to  identify potential candidates for automation

- ## System
#System #Model #Types  #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
System models  describe important aspects of the user interface such as  the set of states the system can be in, the set of actions the  system is able to perform, the set of events the system is  able to react to and the state changes that occur when  such events or actions are performed

- ## Goals
#Goals #HAMSTERS #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Goals or sub-goals are modeled using the type of task  called “abstract”. An abstract task can be refined in 3  types of tasks: “user task”, “system tasks” and  “interactive tasks”

HAMSTERS is an acronym that stands for Human- centered Assessment and Modeling to Support Task  Engineering for Resilient Systems. It is inspired from  existing notations, in particular from Concur Task Trees  (CTT) [9]

First, it is Petri Net based, and then suitable to specify the  behaviour of event driven-interactive systems and  concurrent human computer interactions and to describe  the inner states of the Interactive Application
