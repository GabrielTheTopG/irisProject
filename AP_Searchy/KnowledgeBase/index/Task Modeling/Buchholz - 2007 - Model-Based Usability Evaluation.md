AWUSA is evaluated as a framework for model-based website analysis,  followed by an introduction of ReModEl, which provides usability evaluation within  an integrated model-driven approach for multimodal user interfaces for applications.

AWUSA  approach is based on real usage data and combines log file analysis, automated  usability evaluation and web mining in one single system. All input, output and  processing data are represented in XML format while graphical output is reported  using scalable vector graphics (SVG) [1].

− Find and visualize users’ paths on a website  − Find and visualize deviations between intended tasks and actual usage  − Find and visualize locations and events where tasks are canceled prematurely

− Find and visualize areas and situations with poor usability  − Provide plausible reasons for detected usability problems  − Find new goals and tasks of users while touring the website  − Classification of different user groups and their mapping of the various goals and  tasks

Usage Pattern Miner extracts significant patterns from the usage data and  computes a similarity ratio for each pair of paths, corresponding to the sessions’  resource sequence

Task Usage Miner extracts information about how the task paths that were  defined by the information architects at design time are met by the real usage patterns  during runtime. This is either done by selecting all usage patterns with a similarity  ratio to the defined task paths greater than a given value or by finding actual usage  patterns which were assigned to task paths that contain the goal resource of a task

User Analyzer is used to identify user groups. This is achieved by clustering  user and navigation data

AWUSA analyzes externally  captured events of the user interaction. A pre-processing step realizes a filtering of  relevant information and afterwards a clustering of events according to the given task  structure, which helps the expert to better exploit the collected data. A succeeding  web mining analyses the observed task path and compares it with the path expected  by an expert

The key difference between both approaches is the  direction of development. AWUSA applies reverse engineering of an existing website  to examine the task structure and ReModEl applies forward engineering to transform  a task model to a user interface.

analysis of captured user interactions should cover the examination of  specific behavior for certain user groups or application types. The identification of  GUI patterns with good usability for certain tasks may provide decision support for  the UI designer. Additionally a reference path through the task model can be  defined for comparing the current user behavior with an expected route provided by  an expert.

RemUSINE (“Remote USability INterface Evaluator”) [12] provides support for  remote usability evaluation and was developed of Paterno et al. [13] at the University  of Pisa, Italy. It was intended to prevent the designer from a high involvement in the  usability evaluation leading to increasing costs.

Consequently the input for RemUSINE covers three sources of data: a task model  specified according to the ConcurTaskTree notation [7], a log file comprising the  events of the user interaction and an association table describing the mapping between  log and tasks.

For instance, web browser events include  mouse movements and clicks, navigation key strokes, loading and unloading web  pages etc. If such events are detected they are logged together with timestamp  information and various related object properties.
