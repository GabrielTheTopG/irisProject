- ## RemUSINE

RemUSINE addresses all three of these issues. We aim to evaluate applications that can be used by many users located in different places

- ## RemUSINE
#RemUSINE #Usability #Evaluation #Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
users' behaviour can be detected using automatic logging tools that store in ®les all the user-generated events during the work sessions

- ## RemUSINE
#RemUSINE #Usability #Evaluation #Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
creates an association between the physical events that are generated by the user while interacting with the application and the basic interaction tasks (the tasks that cannot be further decomposed in the task model and require only one action to be performed)

- ## UserInterface
#UserInterface #Design #Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Usability engineering (Nielsen, 1993) concerns the development of systematic methods to support usability evaluation

- ## USAGE
#USAGE #UserInterface #Design #Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
USAGE (Byrne et al., 1994) that provides a tool supporting a method where the user actions, required to execute an application action in UIDE, are analysed by the NGOMSL approach

- ## USAGE
#USAGE #UserInterface #Design #Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
However, this information is still limited in compar- ison with that contained in the logs of the user actions performed during work sessions.

- ## Expressiveness
#Expressiveness  #Notation #Challenges #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
less attention has been paid on how to use such an automatic support to identify more precisely errors in user interactions and, consequently, the problematic parts of a user interface

- ## Expressiveness
#Expressiveness  #Notation #Challenges #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Current automatic tools, such as ErgoLight (Harel, 1999), that support usability evaluation by task models, use simple notations to specify such models, thus still depending on the evaluator to identify problematic parts.

- ## Task
#Task #Quality #Factors #Challenges #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
usability testing is not widely used because it is highly time-consum- ing and expensive to bring users and evaluators together for a usability experiment and to perform analysis of empirical data, which is mainly manual

- ## Task

problem is how to automatically identify the tasks that the user intends to perform
