- ## Selection
#Selection #rules #Terminology #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
If there is more than one method to accomplish the same goal, then selection rules are required. Selection rules are the personal rules that users follow in deciding what method to use in a particular circumstance

- ## Methods
#Methods #Terminology #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Methods are well-learned sequences of subgoals and operators that accomplish a goal.

- ## Operators
#Operators #Terminology #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Operators are the actions that the software allows the user to take

- ## Elicitation
#Elicitation #Methods  #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
empirical techniques, (e.g., keystroke logging, think-aloud usability tests, and critical-incident reports) to judgement techniques (e.g., Heuristic Evaluation [MOLI90] and expert review), walkthrough techniques (e.g., Cognitive Walkthrough, [WHAR94]), and user models (e.g., GOMS, [CARD83]).

- ## Applications
#Applications #GOMS #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
GOMS analysis can produce quantitative and qualitative predictions of how people will use a proposed system after they have become skilled [JOHN96b]

- ## Applications
#Applications #GOMS #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
GOMS models can provide useful qualitative insight into a design. First, the models can explain the causes of their quantitative predictions (e.g., [GRAY93])

- ## Applications
#Applications #GOMS #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
The utility of GOMS models has precipitated their use in industry (e.g., [BEAR96]

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #GOMS #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
GOMS describes the skilled user's knowledge of how to perform a task in terms of goals, operators, methods, and selection rules [CARD83; JOHN96a; JOHN96b].

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #GOMS #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
GOMS has often been viewed as extremely time- and labor-intensive, as a sort of "Cadillac" of technique to be used only when cost is no object (e.g. [LEWI94; LAND95])

- ## KLM
#KLM #GOMS #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Keystroke-Level Model (KLM) [CARD83]

- ## KLM
#KLM #GOMS #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
First, we have observed that people often forget to include physical operators necessary to do the task [JOHN94]. Second, it is “tricky” to place mental operators [KIER93] and even more difficult to be consistent when placing them. Finally, since general-purpose tools like text- editors and spreadsheets do not support the KLM analysis task well, the analysis can be quite time consuming.

- ## Generation
#Generation  #Models #from #User #Interaction #Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
The transformation from event-oriented information into a KLM is done primarily through simple pattern matching.

- ## Generation
#Generation  #Models #from #User #Interaction #Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Operators for physical actions correspond to relatively straightforward patterns. However, some exceptions exist because of the physical limitations of the human demonstrator

- ## CRITIQUE
#CRITIQUE #Usability #Evaluation #Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
CRITIQUE usability evaluation tool that is being developed to help remedy this situation by automating a number of evaluation tasks

- ## CRITIQUE
#CRITIQUE #Usability #Evaluation #Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
CRITIQUE system. CRITIQUE – the Convenient, Rapid, Interactive Tool for Integrating Quick Usability Evaluations

- ## CRITIQUE
#CRITIQUE #Usability #Evaluation #Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
The current CRITIQUE tool allows these models to be produced from the demonstration of an example task in a running interface as illustrated in Figure 1 (a composite of an example interface and the display of a model generated later by the CRITIQUE tool).

- ## CRITIQUE
#CRITIQUE #Usability #Evaluation #Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
CRITIQUE does not require the analyst to build a prototype, for it can be used as a stand-alone KLM tool

- ## USINE
#USINE #Usability #Evaluation #Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
combined modeling with other parts of the system development cycle. [LECE98] has shown value in comparing predicted task models to actual user logs to provide information such as which tasks have been accomplished

- ## Task
#Task #Identification #Challenges #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
expected future work include techniques for more automatic goal hierarchy, method, and selection rule creation. This will be done using more sophisticated pattern matching techniques in the event log and may also use additional information about how events are used within the software

- ## Integration
#Integration  #SDLC #Challenges #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
integrated tool like CRITIQUE could completethe support for all aspects of the implement-evaluate “loop”, making iterative design a practical reality
