The Data Model consists of an object class hierarchy in which each object has an associated set of attributes and methods. The attributes and methods of an object are either internal or external.

A User Model has to be related to an interaction or device model (in the figure termed Dialog Model). This relationship of individuals to interactive technology has primarily to reflect what type of interactive devices is available to a user, and can actually be used by him/her (at a certain level of skills). A User Model has also to be related to a Task Model, in particular, reflecting which work tasks are assigned to a user and how this user accomplishes these work tasks. Finally, a User Model has to be related to a Data Model, since interactive applications provide mechanisms for data manipulation

User Models, in general, are related either to the organizational context or to interaction facilities directly. No general guidelines can be derived on how to relate User Models to other models â€“ the approaches are too diversified to that respect

model-based approach that supports the explicit understanding of users and their organization of work. It is based on various models: Task-Domain Model (including a model of the organization and its workflows), Problem-Domain Data Model, User-Domain Model and Interaction- Domain Model. As indicated in Figure 4, these models have to be related to each other statically and dynamically

Static User Modeling. Users of interactive applications can be categorized according to (i) their individual skills, experiences, and preferences in the context of their work tasks, the application domain data

- ## ContextDependent
#ContextDependent #User #Interaction #Characteristics  #Notations #Notations  #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Dynamic User Modeling. As users as well as work settings change over time, user- modeling components have to support (i) changing individual skills and preferences, either with respect to interaction styles and devices or task accomplishment;

Rich (1989) proposed user stereotypes containing similar patterns of actions with respect to the same prescribed task specification. Stereotypes are described through: User experience with respect to that task, system experience, task motivation, and experience with handling interactive devices

ADEPT framework (Wilson et al., 1996) for prototyping-oriented development of interactive systems is a task- and model-based approach. It consists of a Task, User, and an Abstract Interface Model (Figure 3).

Semantic task knowledge refers to objects of the application domain, as well as actions required for task accomplishment. This type of knowledge represents the other part of application-domain knowledge
