Card et al. (1983) developed GOMS as an engineering model for human performance to enable quantitative predictions (chap. 4). By incorporating tables of parameter values that rely on a cognitive architecture, GOMS can be used as an engineering approach to task design (Beard, Smith, & Denelsbeck, 1996). The original GOMS model, referred as CMN-GOMS (Card et al., 1983), is the root of a family of models that

Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA; Annett & Duncan, 1967; chap. 3) was a pioneering method of task analysis. It was primarily aimed at training users to perform particular tasks. On the basis of interviews, user observation, and analysis of existing documents (e.g., manuals, documenta- tion), HTA describes tasks in terms of three main concepts (Fig. 6.1): tasks, task hierarchy, and plans. Tasks are recursively decomposed into subtasks to a point where subtasks are allocated either to the user or the user interface, thus becoming observable. The task hierarchy statically represents this task decomposition. The decomposition stopping criterion is a rule of thumb referred to the p × c rule

Any task can be expressed in terms of goals that are reached when the corresponding task is accomplished. Each goal has a status (i.e., latent or active) and conditions to be satisfied. The advantage here in HTA is that goals are independent of the concrete means of reaching them. Therefore, for each goal at any level of decomposition, For each goal, several different operations for reaching the goal can be imagined and specified

HTA provides a graphical representation of labeled tasks and a plan for each hierarchic level explaining the possible sequences of tasks and the conditions under which each sequence is executed. HTA also supports task analysis for teamwork, as described in Annett, Cunningham, and Mathias-Jones (2000; see also chap. 3)
