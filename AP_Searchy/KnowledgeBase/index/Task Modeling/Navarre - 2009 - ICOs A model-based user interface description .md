The use of ICOs and PetShop is presented on several large-scale systems such as a multimodal ground segment application for satellite control, an air traffic control interactive application, and an application for new generation of interactive cockpits in large civil aircraft such as Airbus A380 or Boeing 787

(which stands for Interactive Cooperative Objects) dedicated to the modeling of in- teractive systems. This formal description technique was first introduced in Palanque [1992] and dealt with form-based user interfaces

The key point is to describe how raw events coming from the input devices are translated into higher-level events used by the logical interaction component

Thanks to Petri nets, an ICO spec- ification is fully executable, which makes possible to prototype and to test an application before it is fully implemented [Navarre et al. 2000].

the link between interaction technique and task execution by making explicit what kind of low-level actions have to be executed in order to perform higher- level tasks and to reach goals.

Petri nets were initially introduced by C. A. Petri [1962] and have been since then extensively used for the modeling of discrete event systems. Petri nets are a formalism that features a complete equivalence between a graphical and an algebraic representation thus making it possible to perform mathematical analysis of models

The dynamic behavior of a marked Petri net is expressed by means of two rules: the enabling rule and the firing rule. A transition is enabled if each input place (places linked to the transition with input arcs) contains at least as many tokens as the weight of the input arcs it is linked to. When an enabled transition is fired, tokens are removed from the input places of the transition and new tokens are deposited into the output places

The CASE tool supporting the ICOs notation (called Petshop) is a Petri nets-based-tool for the design, specification, prototyping, and validation of interactive software.

Since the late 1960’s [Parnas 1969] a lot of work has been devoted to nota- tions for user interface description. This section presents an excerpt of such work focusing on 25 specific contributions. These contributions have been se- lected either because they provide a unique and important contribution or be- cause they played a pioneering role in the area of User Interface Description Languages (UIDLs)

In the area of Petri nets, such analy- sis techniques can be used for the detection of deadlocks (when no transitions are available/fireable in the Petri net model), the presence or absence of a ter- minating state, the boundedness of the model, the liveness of the model, the reversibility and home state, or to verify requirements

Thus, we usually use the result of classical property analysis as an indicator that highlights potential problems in the Petri net. Verifying these properties directly on the ICOs model is still a research challenge for the Petri nets community, that is still focusing on Petri nets with reduced expressive power such as colored Petri nets [Jensen et al. 2007].

the complexity of the interaction technique in order to be able to predict users’ difficulties in interacting with the application. In order to get more figures about this complexity we need to apply our approach to several interaction techniques and to analyze correlations with the results from actual usability tests

The second level contains descriptions which manage higher-level events (such as clicks, drag, etc.) by combining raw events
