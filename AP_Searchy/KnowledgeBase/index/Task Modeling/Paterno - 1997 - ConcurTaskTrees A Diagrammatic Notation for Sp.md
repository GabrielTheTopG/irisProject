- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
A task defines how the user can reach a goal in a  specific application domain.

- ## Tasks
#Tasks #Terminology #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Specification of the component  performing the task

- ## Actions
#Actions #Terminology #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Action: ”Most task models do not make a clear distinction between tasks and actions but rather they decompose tasks up to the level that is relevant for the analysis” [13]. In contrast to [23] an action is considered as a separate concept.

- ## Objects
#Objects #Terminology #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Object: Objects serve to describe task environments. Their relationship to tasks is specified by the uses-relation in [13],[23].

- ## Temporal
#Temporal #Operators #Terminology #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
operators that we use to describe the temporal  relationships are:

- ## Task
#Task #Types #ConcurTaskTrees #CTT #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
user tasks are performed entirely by the user, they  require cognitive or physical activities

- ## Task
#Task #Types #ConcurTaskTrees #CTT #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
application tasks are completely executed by the  system.

- ## Task
#Task #Types #ConcurTaskTrees #CTT #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
interaction tasks are performed by user  interactions with the system.

- ## Task
#Task #Types #ConcurTaskTrees #CTT #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
abstract tasks are tasks which require complex  actions,

processing tasks, given an input they perform  some processing and then provide a related result;  • control task, their main purpose is to generate an  event control:

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #GOMS #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
hierarchical logical structures which were  introduced by GOMS (Card et aI., 1983) have  proved to be a useful way to represent task models  because they allow designers 10 reason about the  design at differenl abstraction levels

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #GOMS #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
GOMS proposal which uses hierarchical task  decomposition but is only able to analyse sequential  tasks

- ## LOTOS
#LOTOS #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
LOTOS notation which is a  concurrent notation.

- ## Notation
#Notation #LOTOS #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
LOTOS (ISO, 1988) operators to express the temporal  relationships among tasks at the same abstraction  level since they have a more formally defined  semantics. Furthermore LOTOS is an international  standard notation already used in various industrial

- ## UAN
#UAN #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
HAN (Hartson and Gray, 1995) as a good  starting point. U AN supports hierarchical  specifications and has operators 10 express temporal  relationships mnong tasks. However we found it had  two main limitations: it has a textual specification  which makes it difficult to read and interpret (for  example to find cross-references mnong tasks)

- ## Complex
#Complex #Task #Decomposition #Characteristics  #Notations #Notations  #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
a hierarchical logical decomposition of the tasks  represented by a tree-like structure;  an identification of the temporal relationships  among tasks at the same level;  an identification of the objects associated with  each task and of the actions

- ## Task
#Task #Modelling #Patterns #Challenges #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
ambiguity in the priority among operators used at  the same level of the task tree;  the need to specify which component of the  Interactive System considered will perform the  task;  additional information about the tasks that could  be used in the user interface development;  the necessity to define better the relationships  between a father task and its subtasks:  new operators for a compact specification of  common situations.

#Expressiveness  #Notation #Challenges #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
If we simply build task models using these operators  the first problem is the possible ambiguity of some  expressions
