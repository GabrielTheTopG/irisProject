An AM- BOSS task model allows the specification of risk assessment factors, barriers protect- ing human beings and material value from harm [7], and the information flow  between tasks.

A correct timing of co-operative actions is frequently vital for the correct and safe  execution of safety-critical processes. We deal with this aspect within the simulation  component of AMBOSS, which takes into account preconditions for tasks and their  explicit link with barriers

AMBOSS contains six different temporal relations:  • SEQ: The subtasks are performed in a fixed sequence from left to right  • SER: The subtasks are performed in an arbitrary sequence  • PAR: The subtasks can start and stop in an inordinate way.  • SIM: All subtasks have to start before any subtask may stop.  • ALT: Exactly one subtask is performed.  • ATOM: This task has no subtasks.

Message preconditions denote the concept that a message containing certain infor- mation is necessary to trigger a task, and allow its correct performance

Deficiencies in the communication between the actors of a socio-technical system are  recognized as a major cause for critical incidents and accidents [4]. Therefore the  integration of this aspect into the task model represents an important expansion for  our approach

As a fundamental theoretical model, we choose the information-communication  model of Shannon and Weaver. In this model communication is seen as exchange of  information (signals) between transmitter and receiver. This excludes a priori a large  part of aspects otherwise coming under the term of communication, such as psycho- logical, social, or ethical issues

every task  and its associated role in a model can be sender and recipient of information

The examination of success or failure of communication necessitates considering  the following aspects of information flow: the actors (transmitter, receiver), the in- formation itself, the transmission medium, supervising control structures, timing, and  the environmental situation

AmbossA is a visual query language which enables the user to define certain rela- tionship structures between AMBOSS elements and to search for them within a task  model

Using these elements, the user can find all tasks executed by a certain role, or all  messages triggering a certain task etc.

In combination with the logical operators AND, OR and NOT, the user can express  complex constellations of AMBOSS elements and search for them

approach provides a rich set of enhancements over classical task mod- els which are especially useful for safety-critical socio-technical systems. As single  concepts they exist in the rich literature on safety-critical systems but they have not  been integrated with the concepts of task modeling before

Task modeling approaches such as ([12], [9], [17], [2], and [5]) primarily concentrate  on the hierarchical decomposition of tasks into subtasks and their relative ordering  with temporal relations.

AMBOSS  provides the typical tree-based editing functions, such as adding a child node or a  sister node; apart from that, however, we allow direct manipulation of nodes and  connections for easy structure manipulation tasks

Another feature of the AMBOSS simulator is the inclusion of scenarios. A scenario  is an instance of the task model, i.e. one concrete task execution sequence to perform  the complete task described
