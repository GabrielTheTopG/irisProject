Task models are descriptions about actors, their goals and actions, their cooperation, and about the task domain

most task-based approaches, one can find the distinction between sub-models describing tasks, users and the domain.

The revised modelling approach describes structures of single persons and not networks of task models of groups

A task is seen as a unification between situations, goals and actions. there is no distinction between a task and a domain model

- ## HigherOrder
#HigherOrder #Task #Models #Metamodels #Characteristics #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
There is an explicit distinction between goals and actions. Goals are struc- tured as networks of sub-goals.

#HigherOrder #Task #Models #Metamodels #Characteristics #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Sub-models describing situations, goals, actions are deeply related. It is as- sumed that they are part of a common underlying mental structure

A basic action is determined by a precondition, an effect and a sequence of oper- ations

An action is directed from an actual to an envi- sioned situation (goal). The artefact-means pattern (see section 3) supports this idea.

Action models are pattern objects. An instance describes one way of com- pletion in a concrete situation.

An action tree can only be executed successfully if its leaf nodes of the action tree are basic actions and the action is sound

context-sensitive interactive systems require more effort in analyzing and designing working situations. You cannot be context aware if you don’t know much about the variety of contexts.

task is considered as a meta- action which produces models about existing situations, goals and actions by applying general domain knowledge

based on the notion of Contextual Task Models (CTM). A CTM is a graph enriched by contextual information, which includes (sub-)tasks as nodes, as well as de-compositional and temporal relations between sub-nodes

MCTM represents all possible variations of a CTM for a given application and consists of a Context-Independent Task Model (CITM), a set of Context-Partially-Independent Task Models (CPITM)

criticized in [7] that most task-based approaches ”do not consider certain dynamic aspects in the problem domain. For example, the user’s role may change during real situations

- ## Goals
#Goals #Terminology #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Goal: A goal is described as an intended state of the task environment which can be achieved by accomplishing the appropriate task. In [13] goals are considered as hierarchically structured.

- ## Roles
#Roles #Terminology #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Role: Roles model the responsibilities of task performances

- ## Tasks
#Tasks #Terminology #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Task: A task is hierarchically decomposed into sub-tasks. There exists temporal relations between the sub-tasks

- ## Actions
#Actions #Terminology #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Action: ”Most task models do not make a clear distinction between tasks and actions but rather they decompose tasks up to the level that is relevant for the analysis” [13]. In contrast to [23] an action is considered as a separate concept.

- ## Objects
#Objects #Terminology #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Object: Objects serve to describe task environments. Their relationship to tasks is specified by the uses-relation in [13],[23].

A cooperative task tree describes an activity which has to be performed by a group of people (in certain roles). Its leaf nodes refer to tasks in the task trees assigned to the appropriate single roles

according to ([19], [7], [6]) the expressiveness of task models has to be improved too.

- ## Task

Hellpach proposed a definition of a task as early as 1922 [21]. He characterized a task as a process, which does not only include its performance, but also planning, designing and evaluating steps
