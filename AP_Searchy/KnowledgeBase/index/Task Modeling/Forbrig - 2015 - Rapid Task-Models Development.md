task model  notations such as UAN [6], CTT [21], MAD [22] and AMBOSS [1] provide hierar- chical task decomposition, which enforces the abstract/refinement mechanism for  dealing with complex models [5].

Other approaches have also been  proposed in [8], [9], [19] or [24] in order to provide reusable elements corresponding  to solutions to recurring problems

Sub-models and sub-routines can be identified based on knowledge of the application  domain. Sub-models are created for modification purposes mainly. This can be consi- dered as grouping on the lexical level. On the contrary sub-routines can be considered  as specifications at the level of semantics of the domain

Generic components of models are tools for reuse. They are on a different  “direction” of abstraction. They or their instances can be on the one hand side part  of sub-models or sub-routines. On the other hand they can contain sub-models and  sub-routines.

Paternó et al. in [5] have proposed a pattern called “Multi- values input Task” where a set of iterative tasks are interrupted by a termination task.

- ## Generic

goal of using generic components for task models is to allow for reuse of model- ing efforts in a more general way than sub-routines

(the global hierarchical view is split into several models).

generic task components helped to improve the readability of the  models but also to improve their quality. It made it possible to avoid minor modeling  mistakes.

- ## SubModels
#SubModels #Task #Reusability  #Extensibility #Characteristics  #Notations #Notations  #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Sub-models are based on the refinement/abstraction principle and make possible to  define elementary reusable bricks in task models.

A large task model can thus be de- composed into several duplications of elementary tasks (called sub-models). These  sub-models can then be reused (as a kind of “copy”) in various places of the same  model and even in other models.

if in a task model, a task “push button” appears many times (because moving the lever  can be performed by users for reaching multiple goals, such as to change gears in a  car to reduce or to increase velocity) the sub-model construct makes it possible to  handle those instances altogether

Sub-models make it easy to explicitly build a library  of elementary tasks that can then be quickly reused

sub-routine makes it possible to describe recurring behaviors and to  describe explicitly the parameters and how they influence the task model behavior.

structuring mechanism reduces the models’ size but, from the point of view  of the HAMSTERS’ user, it diminishes the global understanding of the model

- ## SubRoutines

structuring mechanism requires skills and knowledge in task engineering, in  order to be able to select the sub-tree that should become a sub-routine and to be  able to select and describe its parameters.

- ## SubRoutines

sub-routine is a group of activities that users perform several times possibly in  different contexts which might exhibit different types of information flows.

An important issue that must be considered when deciding the structure of task  models is its potential for reuse [5]. The reuse of software artifacts has been the sub- ject of research for many years in the software community

Complexity in models is a  recurrent problem with model-based approaches that might require significant availa- bility of resources which is sometimes perceived as too much effort, too long to pro- duce and not being cost effective enough.

- ## Expressiveness

In [15], a detailed argumentation is presented about the fact that abstraction and re- finement of task models is not sufficient for handling large real world applications.  For that two mechanisms were proposed (sub-models and sub-routines) to deal with  complexity in task models.
