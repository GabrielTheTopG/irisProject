l. The main difference between a  task model and a scenario is that a scenario indicates only  one specific sequence of occurrences of the possible  activities while the task model should indicate all the  possible activities and the related temporal relationships

n ConcurTaskTrees, a formal notation with a  wide variety of temporal operators supporting user interface  design and usability evaluation that we are using to support  the design of interactive safety-critical application

At the first level there are two concurrent (111 operator)  activities. They are decomposed into sequential (>> or []>>  operator) or disabling ([> operator) or mutually exclusive  ([] operator) activities.

identify the  hierarchical structure among tasks and define their temporal  relationships. The input for this phase is the list of tasks  identified with the scenario support. This list is not  definitive

s. However they all share a  common problem: many designers often found them  difficult to apply, especially designers working in industries  that often do not have strong background in structured  methods and have hard time deadlines in their project
