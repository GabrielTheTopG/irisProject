The hierarchical structure of this specification has two advantages: i) it provides a large range of granularity allowing large and small task struc- tures to be reused, ii) it enables reusable task structures to be defined at both a low and a high se- mantic level

Reusability is an important issue in every stage of application development. Object- orientation is a well-known approach for analysing, designing and implementing ap- plications which simplifies the reuse in each of these three phases of the software de- velopment process, [1, 14]

Many reusable structures or patterns that occur in object- oriented systems, have been documented [7, 3]

found reusable task struc- tures useful to speed-up the process of building task models for discussing design so- lutions because they incorporate immediate solutions for recurrent problems.

There are at least two basic prob- lems: i) to identify the characteristic situations which can occur in different applications, ii) to identify the information that should be used to define instances of these dia- logues patterns.

Multi-values Input Task appears in every application in which the user edits various values until (s)he decides to submit them.

Search Task is a very common task template, because it allows a user to search for specific information

Evaluation Task is a more complicated template (see Figure 4). It consists of two activities, selection of the data to be evaluated and the evaluation itself, which can be repeated until the user decides to stop

Recursive Activation Task template captures the recurrent situation in many dynamic modern user interfaces which makes available an initial task whose main purpose is to allow the user to activate new instances of another task
