manual expert-based activity. This is made clearly visible by the “is the error credible?” step in the process where identification of errors can only come from deep understanding of operators activities and possible deviations

However, errors related to strategic knowledge and errors related to temporal ordering (e.g. the task model describes a sequence of tasks but the operator performs them in parallel) were not presented even though covered by the approach.

- ## GenotypePhenotype
#GenotypePhenotype #ory #Taxonomies #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Hollnagel [9] proposed a terminology based on 2 main concepts: phenotype and genotype. The phenotype of an error is defined as the erroneous action that can be observed. The genotype of the error is defined as the characteristics of the operator that may contribute to the occurrence of an erroneous action.

- ## GenotypePhenotype
#GenotypePhenotype #ory #Taxonomies #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
As pointed out in [23] investigating the association between a phenotype and its potential genotypes is very difficult but is an important step in order to assess the error-proneness of an interactive system

Reason [30] takes advantages of the contributions of Norman and Rasmussen, and distinguishes three main categories of errors:

- ## GEMS
#GEMS #Taxonomies #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Reason proposed a model of human performance called GEMS [30] (Generic Error Modelling System), which is also based on the SRK model and dedicated to the representation of human error mechanisms. GEMS is a conceptual framework that embeds a detailed description of the potential causes for each error types above

- ## GEMS

Human Reliability Assessment (HRA) methods (such as HET, CREAM or HERT) provide means for identifying human errors. Such approaches go beyond early work of Norman on typologies of human errors [20] which have then been integrated in the action theory [21]
