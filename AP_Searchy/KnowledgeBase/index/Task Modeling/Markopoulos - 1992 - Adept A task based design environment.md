Task Models; A task model is a symbolic representation of that which the modeller considers significant about a task. Task models may be used descriptively, predictively, and prescriptively,

- ## Methods
#Methods #Terminology #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
procedures, which are sequences of actions that the user performs without any "planning" activity taking place.

- ## Task

Relating task models and user models has been considered from a slightly different perspective, because they both relate to the user information processing system. The user model, in terms of knowledge characteristics and expertise level in knowledge systems, was seen to be associated with the tasks, jobs, and roles

description of users in terms of their knowledge characteristics can act as a source of design choice rationales and validations. While the detailed task model of TKS provides correspondences with an interface, in terms of e.g. the taxonomic elements and the interface elements, it is also possible that other interface elements may be introduced in the design which have no correspondences with the task model.

direct mapping between the task model goal substructure and the dialogue model is therefore explicated when the goal substructure is written in CSP

- ## Interface

Interface Model: Models of user interfaces have been created to satisfy the need to represent abstractly the logical decomposition of an interface to its components and their dynamic behaviour. The most influential models have been the Seeheim [15] and the PAC [5] models.

User Models: There are many different definitions of the term ‘user model’, and a range of potential roles that ‘user models’ can play in design. A user model concerned with the knowledge characteristics of groups of users

#User #Model #Types  #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
(i.e. systems of domain knowledge, or systems of across-domain knowledge) that are associated with members of that group

Task Knowledge Structure theory [11].

- ## TKS

This theory is unified into a theoretical framework which encompasses user, task and user interface models and which expresses their relationships.

- ## TKS

TKS is a well established task modelling approach based on knowledge elicitation and description techniques

The basis of this approach is to develop an understanding of how a user conceives of a task scenario (and their corresponding knowledge about elements of that task, such as task objects), and in addition a high-level description of any device implementation related to the task scenario
