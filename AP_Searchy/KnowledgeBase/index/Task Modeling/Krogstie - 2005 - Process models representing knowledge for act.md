Physical quality has two goals: externalisation and internalisability. Externalisation means a model is avail- able as a physical artefact, representing the knowledge of some social actor using statements of the modelling language. Internalisability means the model is available and persistently enabling the model audience to interpret it.

Empirical quality, as Figure 1 suggests, can be evaluated looking only at the model itself, comprising comprehen- sibility matters such as layout for graphs and readability indexes for text.

Syntactic quality has the goal of syntactic correctness, that is, that all statements in the model are according to the syntax and vocabulary of the modelling language.

Semantic quality has the quality goals of validity and completeness. Validity here means that all statements in the model are correct and relevant to the problem, while completeness means that the model contains all state- ments that would be correct. Since we cannot proceed with modelling endlessly, we have introduced the notion of feasibility relative to the goals of modelling

Pragmatic quality is the correspondence between the model and the audience’s interpretation of the model and has one goal, comprehension, meaning that the model has been understood.

Social quality has the goal of feasible agreement where agreement covers agreement in knowledge, agreement in interpretation, and both relative and absolute agreement.

Organisational quality sees that the model is fulfilling the goals of modelling in the first place.

Shortcomings: Some empirical testing of using the framework for evaluating models was carried out in Moody et al. (2002a and 2003), showing that the participants had problems in making reliable evaluations by means of it.

semiotic framework for evaluating the quality of conceptual models was proposed by (Lindland OI, Sindre G and Sølvberg A (1994)

A semiotic framework (henceforth called the SEQUAL framework) for evaluating conceptual models was originally proposed in Lindland et al. (1994).

What the revision does not fix is the framework’s disability to facilitate precise, quantitative evaluations of models – it is still focussed on qualitative evaluations and on the understanding of quality in modelling more than being an instrument for scoring of models

Models are generally defined as explicit representations of some portions of reality as perceived by some actor (Wegner & Goldin, 1999)

the modelling of business processes or workflows often plays a central part (Hjalmarsson & Lind, 2004).

Greenwood et al. (1995) argue that active models can enable information systems to meet many business needs that current technologies fail to support.

Model activation is the process by which a model affects reality. Model activation involves actors interpreting the model and to some extent adjusting their behaviour accordingly

The most comprehensive theoretical approach to this field is Peter Wegner’s interaction framework (Wegner, 1997; Wegner & Goldin, 1999).

The primary characteristic of an interaction machine is that it can pose questions to users during its computation. The process can be a multi-step conversation between the user and the machine, each being able to take the initiative.

Information Systems Actability Theory (Goldkuhl & A˚ gerfalk, 2002; A˚ gerfalk, 2003) stresses that information systems are action systems used in a social action context (A˚ gerfalk & Eriksson, 2003).
