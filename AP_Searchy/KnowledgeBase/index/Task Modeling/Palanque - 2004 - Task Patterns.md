#TAFEI #Human #Error #Detection #Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
TAFEI approach consists of three stages, a Hierarchical Task Analysis (although any technique is acceptable), construction of a State Space Diagram (SSD) mapped with the HTA plans, finally construction of a transition matrix to display state transitions

- ## Task

Task analysis and modelling approaches have always focussed on standard behaviour of users leaving user error analysis for later phases in the design processes (Barber & Stanton 2004).

Following the task analysis and modelling, each low-level sub-task can been considered for possible human error events that may occur

- ## Routine
#Routine #comparison #Error #Detection #Methods #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Baber and Stanton (Barber & Stanton 2004) propose that a system image implies a set of routines that a person may use and that the selected routine will be based on the user’s goal and previous experiences.

- ## PatternBased

- ## PatternBased
#PatternBased #Error #Detection #Methods #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
patterns of tasks have been modelled and can be directly reused within a task model in order to represent potential deviations of user behaviour

exploiting classification of user error provides a systematic way of dealing with possible user errors,

proposal is much more concrete and grounded on previous work in the field of user error identification and classification. For instance we have more than 20 types of errors that would fit within the “other-than” guideword

Task patterns for interactive systems design is a relatively new concept with the aim of solving design problems using existing knowledge of previously identified patterns and solutions

- ## PatternBased
#PatternBased #Error #Detection #Methods #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Work presented in (Sinnig et al., 2003) focuses on establishing and integrating patterns as building block

(van Welie et al., 2000) also addresses the issues raised by user interaction stating that patterns for user interface design should help make systems more usable for humans.

- ## PatternBased
#PatternBased #Error #Detection #Methods #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Task patterns were first introduced by Paternò (Breedvelt et al., 1997 & Paternò 1999) as reusable structures for task models. The patterns were described as hierarchical structured task fragments that can be reused to successively build the task model.

- ## PatternBased
#PatternBased #Error #Detection #Methods #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
In (Sinnig et al., 2003) they describe two types of patterns: task and feature.

task models contain repetitions which can now be re-labelled as task patterns.
