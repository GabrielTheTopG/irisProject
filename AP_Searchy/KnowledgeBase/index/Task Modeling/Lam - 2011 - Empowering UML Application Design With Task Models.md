a set of predefined constructs allowing to  transform task models into use case diagrams and use case  descriptions is needed to this end

Once the task model stands, a set of rules will be applied on  it to generate a corresponding use case diagram and a  description for each use case.

goal of a task is described by two ordered states of  the system, termed "Input" and "Output"

- ## TIM
#TIM #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Any task that may only be engaged under some  definable system configuration is considered as  "Conditional".

- ## TIM
#TIM #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Only tasks that do not unfold into subtasks (termed  "Last-level Tasks") contain a list of one or more  (ordered) actions allowing to reach the goal they  describe

- ## TIM
#TIM #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Any last-level task may have more than one procedure  allowing to reach its goal.

- ## TIM
#TIM #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Any task that needs to be carried out more than once in  order to allow a superordinate goal fulfillment is  considered as "Cyclic" ("Undoing a bolt", for example,  within the process of unmounting a wheel). The  referred superordinate goal acts as the cycle-stop  condition for task engagement

- ## TIM

In a task hierarchy, first-level tasks capture the goal of  a user interacting with a system

- ## TIM
#TIM #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Subtasks are categorized as "Optional", "Non-optional"  and "Alternative".

- ## TIM
#TIM #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
An Alternative task can be carried out more than once  if more than one of the goals appearing in its  (alternative) subtasks need to be reached

- ## TIM
#TIM #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Optional subtasks are those that, if not engaged, do not  disrupt the process allowing to reach the goal of their  superordinate task ("Changing the format of a file",  within the "Saving a file" process)

Within task modelling, the steps contributing to goal  achievement are considered from the user's perspective. Tasks  may unfold into subtasks or actions within a hierarchical  structure, and may be associated with inputs, outputs, pre- and  post-conditions, performance values, time of execution  prediction, etc.

Besides, the engineering of task models is an incremental  process that allows for a top-down strategy, starting at first- level tasks to capture the user's goals, then sub-tasking these to  define system transactions, and finally designing user-system  interactions within the description of last-level tasks

Software engineers are focused  on the tasks a user has to perform, on the object he has to  manipulate and on the work situation" [7], the idea of  promoting task models as a critical component for application  design is currently gaining growing attention [9]

Nevertheless, Sinnig [4] notes that â€œThe industry and the  mainstream developers have not adopted task models as a key  method to elicit user requirements

Beyond deployment, generating use case diagrams and use  case descriptions from task models bridges a significant gap in  well acknowledged software engineering methods

he  collaboration of stakeholders (customers and customer stories  for the first level, architects for the remaining ones) in the  setting up of models is, thus, one of the major interests of a  task-driven design process

According to Paris [10],  the main reason for this situation is the complexity of task  models, which are considered to be hard to build and maintain.
