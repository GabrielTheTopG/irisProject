#Task  #System #Models #Mapping #between #Models #Types  #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
task models and system  model must remain compatible as they represent two  different views of the same world. How such compatibility  can be assessed has been presented in [9].

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #HAMSTERS #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
HAMSTERS involves extensions such as  conditions associated to task executions, data flow across  task models etc. extending its expression power beyond the  one of CTT

- ## Task
#Task #Attributes #HAMSTERS #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
each task in HAMSTERS can be iterative,  optional or both

- ## Task
#Task #Attributes #HAMSTERS #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
iterative refers to a task that can be  executed one or several times but can be interrupted or  suspended by another task

- ## Task
#Task #Attributes #HAMSTERS #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
optional task is a task that  does not necessarily needs to be executed. During the  simulation, an optional task will be proposed with the  following task(s) to be executed

OPERATOR TYPE WITHIN HAMSTERS

by definition task models  represent an abstract predictive view on operators’  activities.

HAMSTERS [7] for the  description of operators’ tasks in a hierarchical way

- ## Task
#Task #Identification #Challenges #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
important challenge here is to  identify which tasks in the task model are good candidate  for automation and which ones should remain operator  driven.

- ## Types

task type has to be associated to  each stage of the Parasuraman et al. [16] model of human  information processing (Figure 1):
