Task trees [7] are used for capturing the hierarchical character of tasks and  activities in an integrated way as well

Task tree models forbid insensible models like the vicious  cycle and are dead- and lifelock free and sound by design

Task trees are frequently used in the HCI community to  specify tasks and user actions in a goal or rather problem oriented way in a  consequently user centered approach. The models are structured and for that reason  readable and understandable [14].

task modeling normally goes beyond business process  modeling to a fine granular user action level.

The collaborative task modeling language (CTML) was developed in conjunction  with modeling efforts in smart environments. It supports the idea of stakeholder- driven process management and has the potential to be used outside the context of  smart environments. We will shortly discuss the fundamentals and main features of  the language.

- ## CTML
#CTML #Notation #Languages #Notations  #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Role-based Modeling. In limited and well-defined domains the behavior of  an actor can be approximated through her role.

- ## CTML
#CTML #Notation #Languages #Notations  #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Hierarchal Decomposition and Temporal Ordering. The behavior of each  role can be adequately expressed by an associated collaborative task  expression.

- ## CTML
#CTML #Notation #Languages #Notations  #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Causal Modeling. The execution of tasks may depend on the current state of  the environment (defined as the accumulation of the states of all available  objects) and in turn may lead to a state modification.

Individual and Team Modeling. The execution of task of individual users  may contribute to a higher level team task.

In CTML the role concept is employed to define the pool of  actions of a user by means of task expressions. In task analysis and modeling this  approach is quite common but is usually restricted to a one-to-many relation of role  and user [15;16]. However this is a rather rigorous constraint

Besides the cooperation model a CTML specification also contains one or more  configurations providing essential runtime information for the cooperation model.

- ## Cooperative
#Cooperative #Aspects #Challenges #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
collaborative task model is specified in a two-folded  manner:

- ## Cooperative
#Cooperative #Aspects #Challenges #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Cooperation Model  Specifies the structural and behavior properties of the model.

- ## Cooperative

Configuration(s)  Holds runtime information (like initial state, assignment) and simulation/  animation configurations.

In the domain of smart  environments it is frequently the case that an actor changes his role at runtime and  that one role is being performed by several actors simultaneously. This might be the  case in our modern business world as well. The role concept implemented in CTML  incorporates this case.

- ## Cooperative
#Cooperative #Aspects #Challenges #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
None of currently existing task modeling supports this assumption even though this  is a common case in working cooperatively. Taking the example of the “Conference  Session” one can imagine the case of an actor presenting a paper in front of the  audience but also listening to other presentations afterward. Therefore, the  simultaneous (or more precisely ordered) performance of more than one role is an  important feature of the language as it also allows separating roles from another since  they are assembled at runtime.
