model-based design techniques aim to reflect  user perspectives they do not support active user  participation. Often, the models are used by designers  only. A generation of abstract prototypes is proposed to  overcome this lack

It can be distinguished between approaches  which try to automate this derivation process (e.g. [13])  and approaches which make the designers responsible for  relating task models and user interface models

goal of this project was the  specification of device-independent UIâ€™s. UIML is based  on XML for specification. To generate a specific user  interface a generation-tool called renderer is needed. For  each possible end-device-type you need a specific  renderer.

DiaTask [6] was developed using  XIML. Task models, user models, and object models  with our metaphor of artifacts and tools are represented as  XIML specification

DiaTask generates the initial abstract user interface proto- type of a dialog graph by producing specific XUL-files  for each view of the graph and associated transitions

DiaTask supplies an own editor for task models. It  follows the idea of attaching artifacts, tools, roles and  devices to tasks. However, models from CTTE [4] can  also be imported.

While the designer has to create  views independently from the task model, DiaTask  supports the mapping of sub-tasks to elements of views.

We provide tool support for the animation of abstract  canonical prototypes and carefully designed user  interfaces. Starting from an abstract user interface a  prototype can evolve to his final appearance by designing  step by step each view of the navigation dialog.
