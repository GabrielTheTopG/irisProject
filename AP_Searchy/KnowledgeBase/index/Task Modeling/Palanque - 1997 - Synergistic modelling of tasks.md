When both task and system models have been built, their consistency must be ensured at the lexical, syntactic and semantic levels. The use of Petri nets for the design of those models is of great help in order to check this consistency

Lexical consistency This kind of consistency is related to the demand of actions from the task model towards the system model and vice versa.

Syntactic consistency This kind of consistency is related to the sequencing of actions supplied by the models and their related demand

Semantic consistency To ensure semantic consistency, some meaning has to be ascribed to the places of the models, and it has to be checked that this meaning is preserved in the interaction between task and system models.

The aim of the formal analysis is to prove that there is no flaw in the models. Using the ICO formalism for describing the models, the analysis is done by using the mathematical tools provided by the Petri net theory. Using those tools, one can prove general properties about the model (such as absence of deadlock) or semantic domain related properties (i.e. the model cannot describe impossible behaviour

Interactive Cooperative Objects (ICO) are an object-oriented formalism dedicated to the modelling of interactive systems. ICO integrate the Object-Oriented (OO) modelling P. Palanque, R. Bastide/Interacting with Computers 9 (1997) 129â€“153 131techniques such as OMT [36] and Petri Nets

Using the ICO formalism, the system is modelled as a set of classes cooperating together. The behaviour of each class is modelled by an object Petri net (tokens can be object classes) and the cooperation between classes is done according to a client-server protocol formally defined in terms of Petri nets.

ICOs were originally devised for the modelling and implementation of event-driven interfaces. An ICO model of a system is made up of several communicating objects, where the behaviour and communication protocol of the objects are described by Petri nets.

summary of this work can be found in [23,22]. The work presented in this section is very close to the one of the GOMS family as it aims at evaluating interactive systems according to the efficiency of use of the system
