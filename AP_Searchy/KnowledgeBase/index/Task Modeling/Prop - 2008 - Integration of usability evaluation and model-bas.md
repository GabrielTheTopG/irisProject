task model-based develop- ment of interactive systems [2]. Task models describe possible se- quences of sub tasks to accomplish a certain goal and temporal relations between tasks [7]

#HTA #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
hierarchical task model describes the decomposition of the root task (also referred to as the user’s goal) into sub tasks that are to be carried out to reach the goal

- ## Generation
#Generation  #Models #from #User #Interaction #Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Task model-based capturing As described in the previous section, we use task models for the design of interactive systems. The initial task models are succes- sively refined and enriched towards a concrete UI. During this pro- cess the link between initial task models and evolving software artifacts is kept

- ## Usability

The task engine [2,11] loads task models in a CTT [7]-like nota- tion and instantiates them.

emUSINE [8] and ReModEl [1]. RemUSINE firstly captures the user interactions and subse- quently maps the interactions to a trace of tasks, which were car- ried out. However ReModEl deploys a task engine which natively recognizes the tasks at runtime and captures the tasks without mapping stage.

The tool ReModEl (‘‘Remote model-based Evaluation”) [1] works in an analog way.

After having introduced the usage of a task engine for task mod- el-based capturing, we subsequently emphasize on the connection between the initial task model and the further refined software artifacts at different stages of development

- ## Evaluation
#Evaluation  #Task #Conformance #Challenges #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Now, in this very early stage of development a domain expert or user can simulate the task model by simply select- ing an enabled task (marked with a green1 circle) and select- ing ‘‘execute”. Finished tasks are checked blue and a red cross marks currently disabled tasks

- ## Cooperative
#Cooperative #Aspects #Challenges #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Different users can work cooperatively at the same task model. An example is a scenario within an accounting department, where one person enters the data and another person is required to double check and approve the data. The individual task traces of both persons have to be joined. 2. Different users can work concurrently at different task models with interdependencies between the models. For instance, let us consider a maintenance scenario with a maintenance person and a worker
