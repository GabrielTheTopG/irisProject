concepts can provide useful support in the various phases  of the development process (provided that it explicitly refers to  a task analysis and task modeling phases such as the one  presented in [9]).

- ## Knowledge
#Knowledge #Representation #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
two main types of knowledge: declarative and  procedural [9].

- ## Knowledge
#Knowledge #Representation #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Information can be elaborated as mental  representations [9] which are hypothetical internal cognitive  symbol that represents external reality, or a mental process that  makes use of such a symbol [9]

- ## Nondeclarative
#Nondeclarative #Knowledge #Knowledge #Types #Knowledge #Representation #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
experiments suggest that “non-declarative knowledge” may  encompass a broader range of mental representations than just  procedural knowledge [10]. All these forms of non-declarative  knowledge are implicit and not easily explainable as they are tacit  [9].

- ## Declarative
#Declarative #Knowledge #Knowledge #Types #Knowledge #Representation #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Declarative knowledge is factual knowledge that  is true or false. It describes objects by specifying the properties  which characterize them. This type of knowledge does not pay  attention to the actions needed to obtain a result, but only to their  properties [10]

- ## Declarative
#Declarative #Knowledge #Knowledge #Types #Knowledge #Representation #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
According to [10], declarative knowledge is represented by mental  images and/or symbolic forms such as words.

- ## Declarative
#Declarative #Knowledge #Knowledge #Types #Knowledge #Representation #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
According to ACT-R [9], all  knowledge begins as declarative information. Procedural  knowledge is learned by making inferences from already existing  factual knowledge

- ## Declarative
#Declarative #Knowledge #Knowledge #Types #Knowledge #Representation #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
declarative knowledge that can be structured and  grouped using concepts (objects or information from the outside  world and knowledge from the user)

- ## Procedural
#Procedural #Knowledge #Knowledge #Types #Knowledge #Representation #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
procedural knowledge corresponds  to the knowledge exercised in the performance a task. It is directly  applied to a task and is acquired while performing activities [9].

- ## Procedural
#Procedural #Knowledge #Knowledge #Types #Knowledge #Representation #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
As  claimed in [10] such knowledge could be represented as scripts  which is a structure that describes sequences of events in a  particular context

- ## Procedural
#Procedural #Knowledge #Knowledge #Types #Knowledge #Representation #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Procedural knowledge can be structured as a  set of rules governing a production. As defined in [10] production  system is the entire set of rules to perform a task or use a skill.

- ## Procedural
#Procedural #Knowledge #Knowledge #Types #Knowledge #Representation #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
rules are organized into routines that are sets of  instructions for accomplishing a task. They can be refined in  subroutines that are sets of instructions to accomplish a subtask.

- ## Procedural
#Procedural #Knowledge #Knowledge #Types #Knowledge #Representation #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
procedural knowledge which  is structured by mean of routines and subroutines, which can be  connected together and thus represented in a hierarchical  structure

- ## Situational
#Situational #Knowledge #Knowledge #Types #Knowledge #Representation #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Situational  knowledge is related to case-based reasoning and contains domain  specific information,

- ## Strategic
#Strategic #Knowledge #Knowledge #Types #Knowledge #Representation #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
strategic knowledge is associated to a  plan, a parallel checking and an analysis of possible choices. They  have to be considered as refinements of the two main types

- ## Hierarchical
#Hierarchical #Networks #Connecting #through #networks #Knowledge #Representation #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Due to the  structuring in routines and subroutines it is possible to adopt a  hierarchical representation to describe them [10]. In such  hierarchical networks information known at a higher level in the  hierarchy is known at lower levels.

- ## Semantic
#Semantic #Networks #Connecting #through #networks #Knowledge #Representation #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
semantic network is a  network which represents semantic relations between concepts  and can be represented as a web of interconnected elements made  up of nodes and labels [9].

- ## Concepts
#Concepts #Knowledge #Representation #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
concept provides a mean for understanding the world and is a  mental organization of knowledge. It is the fundamental unit of  declarative knowledge, and often a single concept may be  captured in a single word

- ## Concepts
#Concepts #Knowledge #Representation #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
As presented in [10] concept  maps are also used as a direct method for assessing knowledge  and can be used for representing the transition from novice to  expert performance [9,10].
