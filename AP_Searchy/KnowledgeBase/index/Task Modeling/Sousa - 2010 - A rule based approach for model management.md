BP is a structured set of activities, performed by organizations’ stakeholders, designed  to produce a specific output for a particular customer or market [8]. Task models de- scribe how tasks can be performed to reach users’ goals when using systems.

BP could not be directly associated to UIs because they represent the business con- text and some of their characteristics make them a limited representation for UI  design, namely: 1) concepts in BPs do not consider automation in itself

In most cases, the BP is not detailed enough  to describe individual behavior and even when it is, the sequence of activities may not  represent the user behavior, strongly influenced by the context of use. However, the  BP structure is suitably similar to the hierarchical structure in task models, which in- fluenced the use of task models as a bridge between BP and UIs

We have implemented an automated transformation converting ARIS models into  jPASS! models. In this case the identification of subjects is facilitated through organ- izational units attached to functions of an eEPC. Figure 6 illustrates the fundamental  concept of the transformation. To start the conversion process the eEPC is exported  into AML, a dedicated XML (provided by the ARIS producer). It contains all relevant  information of the model. This XML tree is parsed into Java objects using JAXB to  lay coherent ground for the actual conversion process

From Business to Task. For each element updated in a BP model, there is a rule that  transforms it into an element in the task model. These rules are classified in  operations that represent actions performed on BP elements that result on actions that  must be executed on task models (Table 1)

Mapping the UI models is supported by UsiXML [21], a UI definition language that  represents models in a structured form and supports the flexibility necessary for defin- ing model-driven UIs
