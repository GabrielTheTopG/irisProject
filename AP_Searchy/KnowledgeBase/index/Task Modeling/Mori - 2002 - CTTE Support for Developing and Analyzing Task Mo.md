- ## Purpose
#Purpose #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Task models can be used for descriptive and prescriptive purposes, for example, to describe how tasks are supported by an existing system or to prescribe how tasks should be supported by a new system to develop

- ## Requirements
#Requirements #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Need for systematic methods to support the specifica- tion, analysis, and use of task models, to facilitate their development, and support designers

- ## Requirements
#Requirements #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Availability of automatic tools to support the various phases of the design cycle

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #ConcurTaskTrees #CTT #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Focus on activities. It allows designers to concentrate on the activities that users aim to perform that are the most relevant aspects when designing interactive applications

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #ConcurTaskTrees #CTT #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Hierarchical structure. A hierarchical structure is something very intuitive

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #ConcurTaskTrees #CTT #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Graphical syntax. Often, a graphical syntax is easier to interpret;

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #ConcurTaskTrees #CTT #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Concurrent notation. A rich set of possible temporal relationships between the tasks can be defined

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #ConcurTaskTrees #CTT #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Task allocation. How the performance of the task is allocated is indicated by the related category and it is explicitly represented by using icons.

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #ConcurTaskTrees #CTT #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Objects. Once the tasks are identified, it is important to indicate the objects that have to be manipulated to support their performance

- ## Notation
#Notation #ConcurTaskTrees #CTT #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
ConcurTaskTrees notation that was introduced in [22]

- ## Cooperative
#Cooperative #ConcurTaskTrees #CCTT #ConcurTaskTrees #CTT #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
specifying flexible behaviors implies increasing the complexity of the specification. Trying to anticipate everything that could go wrong in complex operations would render the specification exceedingly complex and large

tool supports the possibility of automatically expand- ing task patterns. This means that, if the designer defines the structure of a high-level task in a point of the model and if the same task has to occur somewhere else, then they do not have to again provide all the specification

- ## KLM
#KLM #GOMS #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
identifying task efficiency (such as in the KLM [9] approach

- ## Limitations
#Limitations #GOMS #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
most GOMS approaches consider only sequential tasks. In addition, the tool support provided for them is still far from what designers and evaluators expect from GOMS tools [3] because of limited pragmatics, partial coverage of the GOMS concepts, limited support for cognitively plausible models, and lack of integration in the development process

- ## Notation
#Notation #LOTOS #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
LOTOS notation [1].

- ## Notation
#Notation #LOTOS #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
LOTOS is a concurrent formal notation that seemed a good choice to specify user interfaces because it allows designers to describe both event-driven behaviors and state modifications.

- ## Notation
#Notation #LOTOS #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
LOTOS has a textual syntax that can easily generate complex expressions, even when the behavior to describe is quite simple

- ## UAN
#UAN #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
UAN (User Action Notation) [17]. It is a textual notation where it is possible to describe the temporal relationships among asynchronous tasks and, finally, the basic tasks (those that are no longer decomposed) are described by tables indicating: user actions, system feedback, and modifications in the state of the application

- ## UAN
#UAN #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
textual syntax of UAN and its lack of tool support has been a strong limitation to its diffusion.

- ## UAN
#UAN #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
UAN is a textual notation with no tool support, thus unsuitable for developing and analyzing large specifications

- ## Usability
#Usability  #Communication #with #Stakeholders #Characteristics  #Notations #Notations  #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling

production space denotes the set of domain objects that model the multiuser manipulation of common artifacts

- ## Dynamic
#Dynamic #State #Changes  #Tasks  #Objects #Characteristics  #Notations #Notations  #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
coordination space covers dependencies among activities including temporal relationships between the multiuser activities

- ## Task
#Task #Reusability  #Extensibility #Characteristics  #Notations #Notations  #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Support for the reuse of good design solutions to problems which occur across many applications [15]. This is relevant, especially in an industrial context, where developers often have to design applications which address similar problems

One of the main problems in task modeling is that it is a time-consuming, sometimes discouraging, process. To over- come such a limitation, interest has been increasing in the use of tool support [8].

, we envision a solution where Use Cases can be used to collect the high-level requirements to be considered in the development of task models. The objects associated with the task model can be integrated with those belonging to a domain model described with UML notations.
