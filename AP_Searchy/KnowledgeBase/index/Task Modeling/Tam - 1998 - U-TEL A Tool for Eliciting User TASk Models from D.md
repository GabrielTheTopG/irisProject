Although there is increased evidence that user-task models are effective in driving a user-centered design approach [2,5], interface designers are having trouble identifying and understanding the target domain’s tasks

interactive tool called the User-Task Elicitation Tool (U-TEL) to elicit user-task models from domain experts based on our methodology

Our approach to eliciting task knowledge from domain experts to interface designers supplements or even replaces observational studies and ad hoc interviews with a structured yet flexible elicitation centered on sample scenarios

The elicitation begins with the domain expert recounting one or more examples of performing a task, and transcribing these examples into a text editor. The expert then refines these descriptions by performing three operations using U-TEL

output of this elicitation comprises: a) the original task scenarios; b) three lists of classified terms (objects, actions, actors); and c) an outline of the task that expresses its hierarchical decomposition and sequencing.

The knowledge engineer edits the task and data models using MOBI-D tools, which provide a formal language that helps the engineer think about task models in operational terms, that is, in terms of computer inputs, outputs, and knowledge representations.

To indicate sequencing, the user selects a subtask node and chooses one of the following options from a popup menu: · Steps must be done in sequence · Steps may be done in any order · Subtask may be repeated

two areas of potential improvements to U-TEL: intelligent assistance and graphical editing capabilities. We plan to add some of the intelligent parsing and advice functions tested in our Wizard-of Oz studies

We have developed a methodology for eliciting models of user tasks from domain experts and implemented tool support for that methodology. Our user-task elicitation tool allows domain experts to refine a textual description of a task into a structured outline.
