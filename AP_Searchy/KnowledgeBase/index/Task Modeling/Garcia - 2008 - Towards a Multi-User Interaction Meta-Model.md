#Characteristics #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
A common definition for a task is “an activity performed to reach a certain  goal” [[25]]. A task model is referred to as any model produced by specific task analysis method. Task models play  an important role because they indicate the logical activities that an application should support to reach user’ goals

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #ConcurTaskTrees #CTT #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
ConcurTaskTrees (CTT) [[18]] there are five concepts: tasks, objects, actions, operators, and roles. CTT  constructors, termed operators, are used to link sibling tasks, on the same level of decomposition. CTT uses a tool  (CTTE) for editing the task model used to specify tasks, roles, and objects as well as the task hierarchy with  temporal operators

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #ConcurTaskTrees #CTT #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
CTT provides us with means to describe cooperative  tasks: a task model will be composed of different task trees: one for the cooperative part and one for each role that is  involved in the task

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #Diane+ #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
procedures describe only the characteristics specific to an application and do include the standard  actions common to most applications, such as quit, cancel, and so on.

described procedures are not mandatory; what is not forbidden is allowed.

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #GOMS #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
engineering model for human performance to enable quantitative predictions

- ## Operators
#Operators #Components #GOMS #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Operators are cognitive and physical actions  the user has to perform in order to accomplish the task goal. Since each operator has an associated execution time  (determined experimentally), a GOMS model can help in predicting the time needed to perform a task.

- ## Methods
#Methods #Components #GOMS #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
the concept of a method is essential, as methods are used to describe how tasks are actually carried  out (Figure 7). A method is a sequence of operators that describes task performance

- ## Methods
#Methods #Components #GOMS #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Tasks are triggered by goals and  can be further decomposed into subtasks corresponding to intermediary goals.

- ## Methods
#Methods #Components #GOMS #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Methods describe how goals are actually accomplished. Higher level methods describe task performance in terms  of lower level methods, operators, and selection rules. The lowest level of decomposition in GOMS is the unit task,  defined by [8] as a task the user really (consciously) wants to perform. Higher level methods use task flow operators  that act as constructors controlling task execution

- ## Selection
#Selection #Rules #Components #GOMS #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
When several methods compete for  the same goal, a selection rule is used to choose the proper one.

- ## Actions
#Actions #Components #GOMS #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
GOMS makes a clear distinction between tasks and actions

- ## Actions
#Actions #Components #GOMS #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
First, task decomposition stops at unit tasks. Second,  actions that in GOMS are termed operators are specified by the methods associated with unit tasks. Action modeling  varies depending on the GOMS model and the method specification

- ## HTA
#HTA #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA; [2]) was a pioneering method of task analysis. Itwas primarily aimed at  training users to perform particular tasks. On the basis of interviews, user observation, and analysis of existing  documents (e.g., manuals, documentation), HTA describes tasks in terms of three main concepts (Figure 6): tasks,  task hierarchy, and plans

- ## HTA
#HTA #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Tasks are recursively decomposed into subtasks to a point where subtasks are allocated  either to the user or the user interface, thus becoming observable. The task hierarchy statically represents this task  decomposition. The decomposition stopping criterion is a rule of thumb referred to the p × c rule.

- ## HTA
#HTA #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
A plan is provided for each hierarchic level. Although the plan is an informal description of temporal  relationships between tasks, it is one of the most attractive features of HTA, as it is both simple and expressive.

- ## HTA
#HTA #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
HTA provides a graphical representation of labeled tasks and a plan for each hierarchic level explaining the  possible sequences of tasks and the conditions under which each sequence is executed. HTA also supports task  analysis for teamwork, as described in [1].
