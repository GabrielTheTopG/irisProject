- ## Purpose
#Purpose #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Modelling systems in a formal way helps to  deal with issues such as complexity, helps to avoid the need  for a human observer to check the models and to write code.

- ## Requirements
#Requirements #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Models produced should be executable, so that system  models can be used as a prototype of the expected final  application

- ## Types
#Types  #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
articulations of task models and  system models. Tasks models are meant to be used by human  factor specialists whilst system models are supposed to be  produced by software engineers

- ## Types

Several tools have tried to deal with the integration of task  models and system models. Mobi-D [ 19] and Trident [ 3]  are the first generation of tools aiming at using information  contained in models to support design and development of  user interfaces

- ## System
#System #Model #Types  #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
System models describe important aspects of  the user interface such as the set of states the system can be  in, the actions the system is able to perform, the events to  which system is able to react and the state changes that  occur when events or actions are performed

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics  #Notations #Notations  #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
The description of artefacts used to perform a task  should be close to the representation of objects  manipulated by the system

- ## Dynamic
#Dynamic #State #Changes  #Tasks  #Objects #Characteristics  #Notations #Notations  #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
User tasks should include elements of the behaviour  expected from the system; e.g. user providing an input  to the system

- ## Dynamic
#Dynamic #State #Changes  #Tasks  #Objects #Characteristics  #Notations #Notations  #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
The formal description of both the "input" aspects of the  interaction (i.e. how user actions impact on the inner  state of the application, and which actions are enabled at  any given time) and its "output" aspects

- ## Dynamic
#Dynamic #State #Changes  #Tasks  #Objects #Characteristics  #Notations #Notations  #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
able to represent all aspects of interactive  systems (dynamic instantiation, multimodal,  collaborative â€¦)

- ## Dynamic
#Dynamic #State #Changes  #Tasks  #Objects #Characteristics  #Notations #Notations  #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Task models should be able to express both qualitative  temporal relationships (e.g. task ordering) and  quantitative temporal relationships

- ## Complex
#Complex #Task #Decomposition #Characteristics  #Notations #Notations  #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
It must be possible to describe tasks models as unities  that cooperate rather than monolithic models

- ## HAMSTERS
#HAMSTERS #Interactive #System #Design #Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
From the tasks specification we extract the set of  interactive tasks

- ## Petshop
#Petshop #Interactive #System #Design #Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
integration relies on the ICO environment  (PetShop)

- ## Petshop
#Petshop #Interactive #System #Design #Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
From the ICO specification we extract the activation and  rendering function

- ## WXR
#WXR #UserInterface #Design #Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
tools and the integration are  presented on a case study of a Weather Radar System  (WXR) embedded in aircraft cockpits.

- ## WXR
#WXR #UserInterface #Design #Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
WXR system was modelled using the ICOs formal notation  [11].

- ## WXR
#WXR #UserInterface #Design #Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
tool supported approach for  bridging the gap between tasks and system views in the  design of interactive systems. To this end we have briefly  introduced a new notation called HAMSTERS for the  description of tasks models

- ## Task
#Task #Modelling #Patterns #Challenges #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
property checking during verification and validation phases  of the development process as described by Hix and Hartson  [5]. Validation phase relates to the question "do we have  modelled the right system?" while the verification phase  addresses the question "do we have modelled the system  right?"
