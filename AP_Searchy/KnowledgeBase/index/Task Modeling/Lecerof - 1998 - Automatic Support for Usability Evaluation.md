Relative User Efficiency–an indicator of learnability; how easy the system was to learn, relating the efficiency of users to that of experts. Productive Period—the proportion of time the user spent not having problems. Snag, Search, and Help times–time spent overcoming problems, searching un- productively through a system, and seeking help

The relevance of the system, how well it serves the us- ers’ needs. • The efficiency, how efficiently users can carry out their tasks using the system. • The users’ attitude to the system, their subjective feelings. • The learnability of the system, how easy the system is to learn for initial use and how well the users remem- ber how to use the system. • The safety of the system, giving the users the right to “undo” actions and not allowing the system to act in a destructive way, e.g., to delete files without telling the user.

- ## Error
#Error #Detection  #Classification #Quality #Characteristics  #Notations #Notations  #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
User performance on specified tasks, measured in terms of task completion rate, completion time or number of errors; • Users’ subjective preference or degree of satisfaction

Learnability, measured in task completion rate, com- pletion time, number of errors, or use of documenta- tion and help desk. • Flexibility, how well the system can change when the requirements change

Effectiveness—how cor- rectly and completely goals are achieved in a certain con- text; Efficiency–effectiveness related to cost of performance (calculated as effectiveness divided by the time)

preorder traversal of the task tree. For every nonoptional task we check if its left brother is an enabling task

Con- curTaskTrees [16]: this notation allows designers to specify the temporal relationships among tasks and other information

GLEAN [9] allow interface designers or analysts to easily develop and rapidly apply GOMS model techniques in order to evaluate a user interface. The GLEAN user (the interface designer) de- velops a GOMS model for an existing or proposed interface and supply a representative task and a description of the interface behavior

AIDE [22] is a tool that uses “simple task descriptions” to guide the design and evaluation of an interface. The aim of the tool is to assist designers in creating and evaluating layouts [21] for a given set of interface widgets
