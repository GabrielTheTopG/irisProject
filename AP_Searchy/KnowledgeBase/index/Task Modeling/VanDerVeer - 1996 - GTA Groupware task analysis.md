ETAG (extended task-action grammar, Tauber, 1988) is a modeling ap-  proach that allows design decisions to be specified in most relevant details (though not  all, e.g., the presentation components are not modeled in detail),

Conceptual events (Fig. 3), as part of an ETAG description, are presented with their  procedural description and the preconditions for enabling the execution of the event. As  can be seen, a conceptual event can be defined as a structure of other events.

#Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
The concept of  ‘task analysis’ is used to indicate different activities: (a) analyzing a ‘current’ task  situation (the result of this activity will be referred to as task model l), (b) specifying a  task situation for which information technology is to be designed (task model 2), or (c)  specifying the semantics of the information technology to be designed (

Many HCI task analysis methods combine more than one of these activities  and relate them to actual design stages (Johnson et al., 1988). O

Sebillotte (1988) presents a method to collect task knowledge and structure this into a  hierarchical model of subtasks. Scapin and Pierret-Golbreich (1989) elaborate on this  method and provide an object oriented formalism for modeling knowledge of existing  task situations, like Sebillotte mainly focusing on activities.

- ## Task

Task models of this type pretend to describe the situation as it can be found in real  life, by asking or observing people who know the situation from experience (e.g.,  Johnson, 1989).

Johnson (1989) considers the aspect of roles and the phe-  nomenon of allocating subtasks to different actors. Most approaches are based on  cognitive psychology (e.g., Johnson refers to knowledge structures in long-term mem-  ory, Tauber refers to ‘knowledge of competent users’>

Ethnography will reveal relevant ‘cultural’ aspects that influence task structures.  Personal contact between students and the students association turned out to be a strong  motivating factor for the book directors to keep up with the current system, even if they  could imagine much more efficient centralized book distribution systems. Some situa-  tional factors show to be very individualized. In analyzing a person-oriented record it  was found that a book director on a single occasion went in person to the teacher to get  a book ordering form filled.

However, the methodology for the structuring of the collected data and  interpretations into a total task domain description is often rather special and difficult to  follow in detail. The general impression is that CSCW design methods skip the explicit  construction of task models 1 and 2 and, after collecting sufficient information on the  community of practice (

- ## Situation
#Situation #GTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Analyzing a task world from the viewpoint of the situation means detecting and  describing the environment (physical, conceptual, and social) and the objects in the  environment.

- ## Object
#Object #Situation #GTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Each thing that is relevant to the work in a certain situation is an object in the sense  of task analysis. In this framework, ‘objects’ are not defined in the sense of ‘object  oriented’ methods. Objects may be physical things, or conceptual (non-material) things  like messages, gestures, passwords, stories, signatures.

- ## Object
#Object #Situation #GTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Non-material objects, and some-  times physical objects as well, may in the task situation be referred to by external  representations of different character: verbal labels, graphics, metaphors, gestures.  Actors that perform a certain role may be objects in a task situation and will be labeled  ‘active objects’

- ## Object
#Object #Situation #GTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
identification of relevant objects will depend on the condition of knowledge  (explicit or implicit) and on whether the object figures in a task for a single person or in  group situations.

related via a type hierarchy, indicating sub-type-super-type rela-  tions. Sub-types inherit the characteristics of their super-type as far as no further  specifications have to be added. Analysis will reveal the exact relations of object  types of certain levels

- ## Object

Semantic relations between object types may metaphorically be indicated by place  relations, where a certain type of object can be ‘in’ or ‘on’ another object type

Tauber, 1990, uses the concept ‘theme’ for this relation in his ETAG formalism),  and where objects may ‘move’ from one place to another (each place being provided  by an object).

- ## Environment
#Environment #Situation #GTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
task environment is the current situation for the performance of a certain task. It  includes actors with roles, conditions for task performance and for strategies and  protocols, relevant objects, and artifacts like information technology that are available  for subtask delegation.

- ## Work
#Work #GTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
approaches refer to goals as the unit of description of work (GOMS: Card et  al., 19831, but we prefer to focus on the structural as well as dynamic aspect of work,  hence, we will take ‘task’ as the basic concept.

- ## Task
#Task #Work #GTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Tasks can be identified at various levels of complexity. The unit level of tasks needs  special attention. Payne and Green (1989) call this the ‘simple task’, but this notion may  either indicate an artifact of a system, or a psychological concept, which sometimes  results in ambiguity in analysis.

- ## Task

omplex tasks may be split up between actors or roles. Unit tasks and basic tasks  may be decomposed further into (user) actions and (system) events,

lots for precondition and postcondition indicate conditions for  starting and ending the task (the task in the example may only be performed if the  meeting initiator agrees, and is considered to be completed only if delivery of all  cancellation messages is confirmed).

- ## Task
#Task #Structure #Work #GTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
task structure will often at least partially be hierarchical. For the indication of  temporal order and dependency structure, concepts like the ‘constructors’ of Scapin and  Pierret-Golbreich (1989) are relevant (see Section 2.1). Task structures for task model 1  are not always known by single actors,

identifiable components of basic tasks or unit tasks, which have a  meaning in performing a unit of work, but which derive their meaning only from the  task they are part of.

- ## Actions
#Actions #Work #GTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
actions are the  smallest elements of a basic or unit task that change or define the meaning of that task.  In describing actions, the goal is to identify the meaning, not the physical characteristics.

- ## Actions
#Actions #Work #GTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
ctions, as parts of basic tasks or unit tasks, are often not explicitly ‘known’ (i.e.,  verbalizable) or actors are reluctant or unable to be very precise in this respect.

- ## Protocols

concept indicates actual ‘rules’ as turn out (via observation and ethnography) to  be applied for decomposing tasks, to be distinguished from ‘rules’ that may be stated  explicitly in instructions which are sometimes not actually followed.

- ## Protocols
#Protocols #Work #GTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Protocols may be  ‘situated’, i.e., the environment and the presence of actors with certain roles may  constitute conditions for protocols to be triggered. In the book-selling design example  we found an example of a ‘rule’

- ## Strategies
#Strategies #Work #GTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
structures that can be considered protocols used mainly by  experts or typically preferred by them. These structures will often be situated in the  same way as protocols are. Strategies may have started from explicit problem-solving  and knowledge-formation episodes and subsequently have become implicit expert  knowledge.

rotocol illustrates the situatedness of strategies.

- ## People
#People #GTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
People are considered in relation to the task world, hence, we need to make a distinction  between individuals and the roles they play.

- ## Actor
#Actor #People #GTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
This label refers to individual persons. Important for task modeling is to identify  relevant types of actors, and to characterize them on relevant characteristics. Types may  be identified based on two different types of variables:

- ## Actor
#Actor #People #GTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
or the detection of which types  are relevant, ethnographic methods may be needed, for the general characteristics of  actors in a certain task world and for the description of relevant types of actors  psychological methods will be the first choice.

- ## Role
#Role #People #GTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Roles indicate classes of actors to whom certain subsets of tasks are allocated, by free  choice or as the result of the organization. By definition roles are generic for the task  world.

- ## Role
#Role #People #GTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
More than one actor may perform the same role, and a single actor may have  several roles at the same time. Roles may be performed temporarily, be negotiated  between actors and accepted or refused. Actors may have internal (mental) representa-  tions of their own roles

- ## Organization
#Organization #People #GTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
‘Organization’ refers to the relation between actors and roles in respect to task  allocation. The organization describes the human structure in the community of practice.  Part of the organization is generic (as far as the structure of roles is concerned), another  part concerns the current episode in the history of the task world

- ## Organization
#Organization #People #GTA #Task #Analysis #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
identification and subsequent description of the organization may be done by archival  and document study, complemented by TKS and ethnographic methods.

- ## User
#User #Virtual #Machine #Human #Information #Processing #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Oberquelle (1984) introduces the concept ‘ virtual machine’ to indicate “the function-  ality of the system . . . where implementation details and details of the underlying  hardware are suppressed”.

- ## User
#User #Virtual #Machine #Human #Information #Processing #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Tauber (1988) elaborates the concept of the user’s virtual  machine (UVM) which indicates the total of user-relevant knowledge on the technology,  both semantics

- ## User
#User #Virtual #Machine #Human #Information #Processing #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
UVM models the detailed solution in terms of technology, where task model  2 focuses on the task structure and work organization.

- ## Activity
#Activity #ory #Human #Information #Processing #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
partly rooted in Activity  Theory or related theories (Nardi, 1996), as much as most HCI approaches are related to  Cognitive Psychology. Activity Theory stresses the importance of the interrelations  between actors, objectives, and the community in the effects of using tools, applying  rules, and the division of work.

- ## Activity
#Activity #ory #Human #Information #Processing #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Hence, in analyzing complex activities (a concept that  can be considered equivalent to the concept of task or goal in HCI task analysis), the  ‘classical’ HCI methods are considered insufficient, focusing only on activities and  knowledge of individual actors.
