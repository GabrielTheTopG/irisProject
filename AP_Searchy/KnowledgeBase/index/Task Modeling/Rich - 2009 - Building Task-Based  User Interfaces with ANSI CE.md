Task classes and instances. A task model defines task  classes. A task instance corresponds to an actual or hypo- thetical occurrence of a task

The first reason is that ANSI/CEA-2018 is a standard,  which makes it possible for devices from different man- ufacturers to interoperate

, ANSI/CEA-2018 doesn’t explicitly represent paral- lelism or include a rich model of time intervals.

The concept of tasks, which might also be called activ- ities, goals, jobs, or actions, is at the heart of the ANSI/ CEA-2018 standard

ANSI/CEA-2018  also supports the specification of partial orders

Task decomposition  Task models are hierarchical. Accomplishing high-level  tasks usually requires repeatedly decomposing them into  increasingly lower-level tasks, or subtasks

Collagen also included a plan recognition  component10—given an observed sequence of primitive  actions and a task model, it could infer which high- level task (goal) was being performed, including which  decomposition choices, if any, had been made. The ANSI/ CEA-2018 formalism would support a similar algorithm
