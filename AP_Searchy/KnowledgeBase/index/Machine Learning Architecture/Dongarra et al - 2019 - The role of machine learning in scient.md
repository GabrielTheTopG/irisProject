The ML-based methods will need to analyze both online and off-line performance and provenance data, and they can be integrated following the principles of the “Lambda architecture” (LA) (Kiran et al., 2015). LA is a generic, linearly scalable, and fault-tolerant data pro- cessing architecture that is able to serve a wide range of queries and computations on both fast-moving (stream- ing) data and historical data (batch). Large volumes of performance and provenance data can be analyzed with both batch- and stream-processing techniques. The stream processing component, the “speed layer,” can encapsulate the ML approaches for online analysis, while batch-processing can be leveraged for the heavy- weight off-line ML techniques at the “batch layer” ana- lyzing data across multiple workflows.

For comprehensive introspection and analysis of per- formance and provenance data, off-line ML-based approaches need to be developed to enable longitudinal analysis across multiple workflow executions. Such a type of analysis can be computationally intensive since it inte- grates and correlates data from multiple workflows, thereby enabling discovery of patterns across workflows. Several supervised and semi-supervised learning approaches (SVM, Random Forest, Bayesian classifiers, etc.) have been shown to be effective in identifying sys- tem and application anomalies. All these techniques rely on the availability of high-quality labeled data to train the ML models to be used later for classification of test cases. Hence, one should use carefully labeled performance and provenance data obtained from workflow executions on isolated and controlled environments to train the ML-based analysis algorithms.
