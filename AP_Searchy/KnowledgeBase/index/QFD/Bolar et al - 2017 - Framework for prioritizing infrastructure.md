customer expectations can be addressed by repeated surveys and constant communication, having indicators to predict customer response would be a valuable tool and aid the QFD decision-making process. In this study, a framework that utilizes hidden Markov model (HMM) is proposed for evaluating customer expectation by using probabilities of focus areas that are of interest to the infrastructure user as hidden parameters.

dynamic customer (infrastructure-user) require- ments can be predicted using hidden Markov parameters for use in decision-making within QFD. A study done in Bolar et al. (2014) considered five focus areas as relevant to infrastructure user requirements

However, starting with available customer responses as input, the focus areas of attention for the cus- tomer (economic, social, safety driven, technical, mainte- nance efficiency and environmental issues) were adopted for estimating future customer requirements

Using the prioritiza- tion scheme in Bolar (2014), the future customer require- ments are input to QFD House of Quality for updating prioritizations evaluated. Fig. 4 shows the HOQ with CRs evaluated using the HMM.

Capturing customer requirements constantly may not be possible as conducting customer sur- veys, collecting information, synthesis, and generating out- comes involve time, human efforts and cost. Using a hidden Markov model, expert opinion can be sought from individ- uals, government agencies or departments with regards to focus areas for the customer. Using those expert probabil- ities for the focus area as hidden Markov parameters, esti- mation of future customer requirements have been circumvented thereby eliminating the need for repeated customer surveys
