The goal of product planning phase is to translate customer requirements (CRs) into engineering characteristics (ECs) and pri- oritize their importance. To achieve this goal, product developers must acquire the CRs from market surveys or customer question- naires. The acquired information can assist product developers to identify ECs, construct a relationship matrix, establish competitive analysis, and calculate the importance of ECs

product planning forms a matrix that is also called the ‘‘House of Quality (HOQ)”. HOQ indicates the rela- tionship between customer requirements (what to do) and engi- neering characteristics (how to do it)

Nevertheless, the result of the market surveys, cus- tomer questionnaires or linguistic terms used is often uncertain, imprecise or ambiguous, resulting in biased analyzed results. To solve this problem, a number of researchers have applied the fuzzy set theory to QFD and have developed various fuzzy QFD ap- proaches.

By focusing on listening to the customers, quality function deployment (QFD), introduced by Akao (1972), has been a success- ful tool to help a company’s product development team (hereinaf- ter referred to as ‘‘the team”) systematically translate customer requirements (CRs) to appropriate product features. Generally, a QFD system consists of four inter-linked phases: product planning, part deployment, process planning, and production planning.

Traditional QFD approaches usually depend on market surveys and customer questionnaires in collecting the importance of cus- tomer requirements (CRs). Moreover, in QFD, product developers usually use linguistic terms, such as ‘‘a little important”, ‘‘not too important”, or ‘‘somewhat important”, to assess various input parameters.

Currently, two main QFD approaches have been popularized: the American Supplier Institute’s (ASI) Four-Phase approach, and the GOAL/QPC Matrix of Matrices approach. According to Revelle, Moran, and Cox (1998), the difficulty with using the Matrix of Matrices is that it may become more of a maze of mazes instead

In essence, the product planning phase translates qualitative cus- tomer requirements into measurable engineering characteristics, and identifies important engineering characteristics
