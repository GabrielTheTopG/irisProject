Huiskonen & Pirttilä (1998), and Tontini & Silveira (2005) discuss some situations in which the  traditional evaluation of importance may lead to misinterpretations regarding the real customer  requirements and, sometimes, to inappropriate actions

The Kano model classifies customers requirements in three categories  (figure 3):  a) Basic Requirements. The basic requirements fulfill the basic functions of a product.  If they are not present or their performance is insufficient, customers will be  extremely dissatisfied. On the other hand, if they are present or have sufficient  performance, they don't bring satisfaction. Customers see them as prerequisites.  For instance, for luxury automobiles, "air bags" are considered basic. A customer  won't feel satisfied if the automobile has "air bag", however he/she will not buy it if  “air bag” is not present.  b) Performance Requirements. As for these requirements, satisfaction is proportional  to the performance level – the higher the performance, the higher the customer's  satisfaction will be and vice-versa. Gas consumption in automobiles is an example  of these requirements. Usually customers explicitly demand performance  requirements.  c) Excitement Requirements. These requirements are key to customer satisfaction. If  they are present or have sufficient performance, they will bring superior  satisfaction. On the other hand, if they are not present or their performance is  insufficient, customers will not get dissatisfied. For instance, a surprise gift at the  end of a dinner in a restaurant will certainly bring satisfaction, but it will not cause  dissatisfaction if not offered. These requirements are not demanded nor expected  by customers.
