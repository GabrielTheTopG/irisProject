#Requirements #Engineering #Al 

Some survey papers on RE and ML have been reported [30], [37]. Iqbal et al. examined many studies on ML for RE, but few on RE for ML [37]. In addition, the latest papers on RE for ML have not been reported. Dey et al. conducted a systematic literature survey for SE for ML [30].
