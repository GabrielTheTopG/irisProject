\cite{gezici_systematic_2022} conduct a systematic literature review to synthesize limitations and open challenges for AI-based software systems. Thereby they take different perspectives, e.g., software quality and development, design, testing, and social aspects, onto the identified challenges. The authors criticize the lack of evidence that existing software quality models/standards can be applied for specifying AI-based software quality.

Braiek and Khomh (2020) reviewed the current testing practices for ML-based systems. They searched on Engineering village, Google Scholar, and Microsoft Academic Search databases and found 37 related primary studies within the years of 2007-2019.

Riccio et al. (2020) performed a systematic mapping study by reviewing 70 papers in the context of functional testing for ML systems (MLS). While we focus on AI-based software, the authors of this study focused on MLS and specifically on MLS testing, challenges, and solutions. While the research questions they defined are specific to testing, the ones in our study are about product quality for AI-based software. Accordingly, their contributions and outcomes are quite different from ours.

Lwakatare et al. (2020) performed a systematic literature review of 72 papers on the development and maintenance of ML-based software systems, their challenges, and solu- tions. This study does not specifically focus on the product quality, and the type of software analyzed by it is ML-based software, while in our study it is AI-based software.

In the previous sections, we have mentioned that there are quality models such as ISO/IEC 25010 (ISO/IEC 2011) proposed for traditional software, but it is not always possible to use these models for AI-based software due to the different nature of these products. There- fore, in this part, we investigate whether there is any traditional quality model adopted for AI-based software or not. Before that, we give a summary of traditional quality models investigated in this SLR study, in the following paragraphs.

Considering quality attributes as specific to AI-based software characteristics is required to ensure the quality of these software systems. Many attempts have been made to fill the gap. However, understanding the problem is still deficient. We categorized the challenges faced by researchers by observing commonalities among several primary studies in this SLR. We

examined these challenges under five categories which are Software Quality, Software Development, Design, Social Aspect, and Testing.

included the difficulties in application of the quality attributes of the existing software quality models directly to the AI-based software.

“Social Aspect”, which were related to the communication challenges between AI-based developers and others, terminol- ogy differences that caused misunderstandings between developers, etc.

According to ISO 25010, which is the latest model and has eight characteristics of software product quality (ISO/IEC 2011), we catego- rized the attributes under these eight characteristics and in addition to these, we defined “Other” category that consisted of the quality attributes except the ones under ISO 25010. According to the results, 73% of the studies examined the quality attributes of the “Other” category, while 28% of the studies investigated the ISO 25010’s qual- ity attributes of “Reliability” and “Security.”

3- There is a lack of evidence that existing software quality models/standards can be applied for specifying AI-based software quality. Therefore, individual context-specific efforts may be more helpful than the efforts spent for using/adopting existing quality models.
