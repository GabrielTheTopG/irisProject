35 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We found several different types of contributions, in the form of analyses, approaches, checklists and guidelines, quality models, and taxonomies

#Requirements #Engineering #Al #Challenges 

Knowledge regarding NFRs. In [P14] the authors state that the understanding of NFRs for ML is fragmented and incomplete, including how to define and refine NFRs in ML- specific contexts.

Handling customer expectations.

difficulties customers have to understand potential limitations of ML systems

customers commonly expect to see magic coming out of data.

Create guidelines related to ML-based system require- ments (training data, specification documents, test design, runtime monitoring, and maintenance).

How to operationalize ethics, security, and privacy.

Extend the ML quality characteristics.

What are the reported challenges and research di- rections on the interplay between RE and ML-based systems?

Lack of validated techniques. Developing ML-components mainly relies on applying techniques to achieve an objective.

researchers and users currently lack an ML-specific way to express and specify requirements for ML, including targets and trade-offs, and the influence of domain context.
