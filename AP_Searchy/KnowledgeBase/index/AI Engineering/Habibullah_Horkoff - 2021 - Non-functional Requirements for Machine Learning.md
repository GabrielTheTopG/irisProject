Habibullah and Horkoff \cite{habibullah_non-functional_2021} conducted a qualitative interview study with ten requirements engineers to explore their experiences and perceptions of non-functional requirements (NFRs) in the context of machine-learning (ML)-based systems. Their study showed that most engineers in industrial settings have difficulties formulating NFRs for ML-based systems. This often leds to NFRs neither being organized, prioritized, nor monitored effectively during the development of such systems.

NFRs. Although NFRs are considered essential and critical for software success, there is no agreed upon guidelines on when and how NFRs should be elicited, documented, and validated [7]. Even so, as highlighted in Sec. I, much work in an out of RE has been devoted to NFRs, so much so that it is difficult to give a brief and complete overview.

Doerr et al. presented the application of a systematic, experience-based method to elicit, document, and analyze non-functional requirements.

Ameller et al. conducted an interview-based survey with 18 different companies from six European countries. They presented the barriers to and benefits of the management of NFRs for companies, how NFRs are supported by Model-Driven Development (MDD),

Vogelsang & Borg have pointed out that the ML-based development process becomes more complex, with the need to effectively use large quantities of data, as well as a dependence on other quality requirements (NFRs) [18].

Belani et al. identified, discussed, and tackled the challenges for requirement engineering disciplines in developing ML and AI-based complex systems [16]. They reported that one of the challenges in ML-enabled software development is to identify NFRs throughout the software lifecycle,

The results illustrate that most NFRs are still considered important in an ML context, and few NFRs are considered less applicable.

RQ1.1: Most NFRs as defined for traditional software are still relevant in an ML context, while only a few become less prominent. Prominent NFRs according to our interviews include fairness, but also flexibility, usability, accuracy, efficiency, correctness, reliability, and testability.

NFR-related challenges. Some NFRs were pointed out as particularly challenging (safety, transparency, accuracy, consistency, privacy, completeness), but other challenges included un- certainty, domain dependence of NFRs, a lack of awareness of NFRs and regulations

NFRs (e.g., accuracy) can be measured using ML-specific or more standard measures (e.g., preci- sion, recall, f1 score), many are difficult to measure (e.g, fairness, explainability) as with traditional software.

We have conducted a qualitative interview study to under- stand the perception of and practices for NFRs in ML-based systems in industry.
