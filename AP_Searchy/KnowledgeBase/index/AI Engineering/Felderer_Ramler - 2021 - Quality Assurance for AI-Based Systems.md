Felderer and Ramler \cite{felderer_quality_2021} discuss terminology and challenges for quality assurance of AI-based software systems. They analyze these challenges along the perspectives of artifact type, process, and quality characteristics. In total, they identify eight key challenges in this context - such as understandability and interpretability of AI models, accuracy and correctness measures, or the handling of NFRs in AI-based software systems.

Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), and their integration into software-based systems of all domains raise new challenges to engineering modern AI-based systems. These systems are data-intensive, continuously evolving, self-adapting, and their behavior has a degree of (commonly accepted) uncertainty due to inherent non-

The knowledge and background of different communities are brought together for developing AI-based systems. While this leads to new and innovative approaches, exciting breakthroughs, as well as a significant advancement in what can be achieved with modern AI-based systems, it also fuels the babel of terms,
