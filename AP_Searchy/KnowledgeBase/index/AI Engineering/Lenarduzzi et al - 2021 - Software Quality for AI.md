Lenarduzzi et al. \cite{lenarduzzi_software_2021} elaborate a method for identification of quality issues in ML-based software systems, collected based on experience reports of their research group and self-ethnography. According to the authors, causes for the most frequent quality issues can be attributed to six groups, ranging from lack of developer skills, development and test processes, model version incompatibilities, and communication deficiencies. The authors underpin that the training of software developers in general is the most effective means to mitigate quality issues in ML-based software systems.
