#Conversational #User #Interface 

Conversational User Interfaces (CUIs) such as chat and voice are becoming more and more popular. These new types of interfaces embed smart natural language processing components to understand user requests and respond to them. To provide an integrated user experience all the user interfaces in the system should be aware of each other and be able to collaborate. This is what is known as a multiexperience User Interface

A bot wraps a CUI as key component but complements it with a behavior specification that defines how the bot should react to a given user message.

IFML is an international standard defined by the OMG that aims at the platform-independent description of graphi- cal user interfaces for applications accessed or deployed on a variety of systems including computers, mobile phones, tablets, and smart devices. It supports event-driven specifi- cation of the interactions and it integrates seamlessly with other languages for the specification of the business logic, including UML and BPMN.
