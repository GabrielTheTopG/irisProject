Kuwajima et al. \cite{kuwajima_engineering_2020} study quality models for safety-critical ML-based software systems. Therefore they analyze the gaps between the SQuaRE standard \cite{25010:2011} and quality characteristics relevant for ML-based software systems. Their results show that the quality requirements towards machine learning models are often vaguely specified, which in turn negatively affects their interpretability and robustness.
