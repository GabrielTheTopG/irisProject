#Requirements #Engineering #AI 

In this paper we argue that significant challenges relate to defining and ensuring behaviour and quality attributes of such systems and applications

D. PA 4: Human Factors

#Human #Factors 

Lee et al. highlight the danger if human factors are not sufficiently considered during AV design, related to achieving sufficient safety, trust and acceptance as well to avoid the miss-use and disuse of the automated technology [24]. integrated in automation design [25]. â€¢ A list of socio-technical challenges [26]. design processes [28].

Understanding human factors is particularly important for building a system that users accept and trust in. To achieve the desired results, it is critical to consider human factors right when the concepts are developed, i.e. as part of requirement engineering.

If a trained machine learning model is placed in another context, desired system behaviour and especially safety attributes can no longer be guaranteed without retraining of the model on the new context.

need of proper definitions of quality attributes of, and requirements on, data that are used in the AI-intense system

Establishing requirements on the context and data for an AI-intense system raised the questions on how the fulfilment of these requirements, and the performance of the AI-intense system can be monitored

problem area are human factors, which especially play a role in the SHAPE-IT project. In SHAPE-IT, we aim to focus on how to integrate human factor requirements in modern, large-scale AV development process to increase the vehicle safety, acceptance and trust
