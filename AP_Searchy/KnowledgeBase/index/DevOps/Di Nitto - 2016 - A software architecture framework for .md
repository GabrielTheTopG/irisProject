The SQUID framework shows the following key features: (a) is based on the empirical investigation of software architecture stake- holders, concerns [1] and challenges around specifying and using software architectures in DevOps scenarios; (b) allows the functional and non-functional specification of software architectures in a manner which is most consistent with De- vOps scenarios;

Lack of automated tools for quality-aware De- vOps: industries recognise the lack of development and continuous delivery of products that has been ver- ified in terms of quality assurance. In other words, there exists many different frameworks that software vendors can adopt in order to develop their applica- tions. However, there is no automated mechanism to enable them to verify software quality across such dif- ferent technological stack in a automated fashion.

Continuous Fine-Grained Application Monitor- ing and Anomaly Detection: Access to live data gathered by monitoring engines should also provide performance and reliability data for observed appli- cations in production to gauge the need for identifying outliers and detecting any anomaly that may harm continuous business processes that are dependent to such data intensive applications

this is critical to have an overall under- standing of software architecture traits that are affected by operational concerns; (b) the software architecture needs to be augmented with deployable images, i.e., there needs to be an architectural representation that allows inferring a con- crete blueprint containing infrastructure, platform as well as application topolog
