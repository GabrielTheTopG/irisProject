#Objectives #DevOps 
Development and Operations (DevOps) is an approach to  solve a disconnect between development and operations teams by  promoting collaboration, communication, and integration between  them [1]. The increasing need for improvement in the business  competitiveness and performance has compelled many IT  organizations to adopt DevOps [1, 2]. Continuous DElivery (CDE)  and Continuous Deployment (CD) are key DevOps practices to  suitably achieve this goal by enabling IT organizations to  accelerate delivering high-quality value to customers [1]

The analysis of the qualitative data also indicates that  although automation is critical in CD practice, manual tasks are  sometimes unavoidable. For example, the organization that P15  helped to adopt DevOps was always able to deploy working  versions to lower environments (e.g., staging environment) in an  hour, yet the step for getting a working version from low level  environment into production involved additional verification and  approval

Our study indicates that there is a well-understood difference  between practicing Continuous DElivery (CDE) and Continuous  Deployment (CD). Specifically, there are factors because of  which organizations may be unable or demotivated to move from  CDE to CD (i.e., having automatic and continuous deployment).

Integrating automated quality checks: Software quality was  one of the major concerns in the interviewees’ and the survey  participants’ organizations before each release. It was also among  the top priorities for business leaders. Security and performance  were the most frequently reported quality concerns. According to  the participants, attention to security needs to increase and  performance testing should be conducted at production scale to  truly implement CD.

Easier tools integration: As we discussed in Section IV.B,  CDP is a tool-chain, which a number of open source and/or  commercial tools should be integrated for this purpose. This is  mainly because deploying with one and only tool would make  automatic deployment process more complicated.

Figure 1 shows that almost 53.7% (64 out of 119  (21+98)) of the participants indicated that on average the  applications in their respective or client organizations were in  deployable-state multiple times a day or daily, indicating they  113were successful to truly implement CDE. However, CD was less  adopted in the participants’ organizations as in total 43 out of 119  (36.1%) participants indicated that the application changes were  automatically pushed multiple times a day or daily to production.
