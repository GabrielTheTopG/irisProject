task is intended  to be performed in days to fulfill  the requirements. The execution must align with the strategic value  stream.9

- ## Continuous
#Continuous #Delivery #DevOps 
Rapid development and continu- ous deployment quickly deliver re- quirements to the customers and  continually allow the consequences  of development decisions to emerge.  As the software accumulates a criti- cal mass of features and becomes  more mature, tradeoffs must be  considered between speedy deploy- ment and other nonfunctional re- quirements such as safe and scalable  deployment. For example, safety sto- ries can be added to the sprint back- log for software systems that have  safety implications at lower levels of  the criticality spectrum.1

However, recent research on au- tomated acceptance tests that are  created as part of behavior-driven  development11 has helped instru- ment more ubiquitous traceability  between agile requirements and pro- duction code.8
