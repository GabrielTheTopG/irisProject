There has been extensive research on traceability between requirements (and other textual artifacts) and source code. 192 194Marcus and Maletic establish traceability links between docu- mentation and source code using latent semantic indexing [23]. Spanoudakis et al. use a rule-based approach to infer these links [30]. In contrast, our work focuses on tracing various kinds of runtime information (including textual artifacts, such as log statements) to source code. The difference is mostly that runtime information (e.g., log statements) are much shorter than comparable software documentation and do not require such rigorous pre-processing as longer requirements docu- ments. Linking runtime artifacts with code is probably more related to tracing in a performance modeling context [17].

Runtime Entity is an abstract structure that includes any information that represents the state of an application and its underlying systems at a certain point in time t = {1,...,T}. State is gathered either through observation (e.g., active moni- toring [11] or system agents) or through log statements issued by the application.

Program File represents an abstract entity that encompasses all sorts of code files that relate to the application and are stored in version control (e.g., a Java file containing a class definition). A code fragment is a continuous set of code lines that is a subset of a program file.

We implemented a proof-of-concept of the context-based analytics framework with a backend in Python. The frontend works as a combination of the Jinja27 template engine and JavaScript with the d3 visualization library8 and Cytoscape.js9 to display and manipulate the context-graph. Figure 3 shows a screenshot of the implementation.

We proposed context-based analytics as an approach to make these links explicit. Our approach consists of a meta- model, which needs to be instantiated in an initial modeling phase for a concrete application, and an online processing phase, in which the context model is supplied with concrete runtime data.

#Challenges #Continuous #Software #Analytics #DevOps 
In this paper, we propose an analytics approach that incor- porates system and domain knowledge of runtime information to establish explicit links between fragments to build a context graph. Each node in the graph corresponds to a fragment (e.g., individual logs, metrics, or source-code excerpts). Edges correspond to semantic relations that link a fragment to related fragments, which we refer to as its context.

causing a partial or total outage, this fast code- delivery cycle is suddenly halted. Paradoxically, this extreme agility in deploying new code could potentially slow down the continuous delivery cycle, as problems might happen more often, and take longer to resolve, the faster new code is deployed.
