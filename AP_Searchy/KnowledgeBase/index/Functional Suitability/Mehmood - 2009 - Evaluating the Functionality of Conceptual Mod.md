Functionality dimension consists of the set of attributes responsible for evaluating  the model quality based on functional aspects.

- ## Quality

Completeness. This attribute is based on the coverage of user requirements. It will try  to evaluate the quality by comparing the conformance between concepts depicted in  the conceptual model and the ones expressed by the users through the requirements.

Reusability. This attribute has been widely recognized and appreciated in the Object  Oriented Paradigm. Reusability is considered a major opportunity for improving  quality and productivity of systems development

Relevancy to requirements. This attribute is different from “Completeness” in a way  that it is employed for finding the relevancy between the concepts present in the  model and the ones required by the users.

Practicability. This attribute is based on the notion of feasibility of the model. It  verifies whether the model employs the concepts or elements that are realistic and can  be materialized

Reliability. A system is reliable if it is not prone to failure. It is important to consider  this attribute at the conceptual level as failure could be hardware or software failure.

Expressiveness. This attribute evaluates the expressiveness of a model. A model is  expressive if it represents users’ requirements in natural way and is understandable  without additional explanation

Functionality is  defined as a set of attributes that expect the existence of a set of functions satisfying  the stated requirements.

- ## Factors
