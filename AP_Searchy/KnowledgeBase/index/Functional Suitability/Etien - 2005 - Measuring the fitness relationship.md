Cavano and McCall framework [15] to de- velop a system of fitness measurement. This framework organising software quality measure is divided into three levels, factors, criteria and metrics.

Factors are charac- teristics that can be appreciated on an external point of view. They can be used as an aid in specifying software quality objectives. These high-level factors are then broken down into criteria that are more software di- rected

These latter correspond to the product charac- teristics and represent the internal and technical point of view

Metrics allow to measure a criterion. The Cavano and McCall framework is still now a reference in the domain of the quality measure

- ## Criteria

support ratio, similar to the technological coverage criterion defined by Bodhuin [13] is the extent to which business activities are supported by the system

The paper proposes criteria and associated generic metrics to quantify to which extent there is a fit between the business and the system which supports it.

For the former kinds of components we use the Soffer and Wand [9] ontology whereas at the system level we use the Wand and Weber (WW) ontology [10]. These two ontologies are adapta- tions of Bunge’s ontology [11, 12] which are largely recognised for its theoretical foundations.

- ## Factors
#Factors #Functional #Suitability #Quality #Aspects #Software #Quality #Models 
intentional factor, the informational factor, the functional factor, and the dynamic factor

- ## Factors
#Factors #Functional #Suitability #Quality #Aspects #Software #Quality #Models 
ntentional factor dealing, respectively, with the business activity and the goal support, and the actor and resource representation

- ## Factors

The intentional factor and its related criteria defined above are focusing on the evaluation of the degree to which business activities are supported by the system

- ## Factors

functional factor aims to measure the degree to which activities in the system correspond to business activities.

dynamic factor aims to evaluate the extent to which business processes are reflected in paths of system state transitions

WW ontology [10] allows to model a software sys- tem. It is the first ontology defined from Bunge’s works [11, 12] and using his concepts. Thus, according to this ontology, the real world is made of things that (1) pos- sess properties and (2) can be composed of other things and can thus be qualified as composite. Properties can be intrinsic (e.g. height of a person), mutual to several things (e.g. a person works for a company) or emergent which refers to the property of a composite thing but not possessed by individuals composing it.
