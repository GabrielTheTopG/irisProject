Data generation for machine learning: Traditional ML/DL model development requires data scientists to spend significant amounts of time to convert available data sets that often are intended for human consumption into data sets that are usable for machine learning. In au- tonomously improving systems, the data that is generated by the system needs to be machine interpretable without any human help. How to accomplish this, though, is an open research question.

What lies ahead: As shown in Figure 1, the domain of ML, in general, brings in many new stakeholders and concerns which cannot be generalized to the standard software architecture practices. These cannot be captured using the existing archi- tectural frameworks and requires the development of novel architectural framework(s) that shall consider the following: 1. Stakeholders: The key stakeholders of a traditional soft- ware system consists of mainly software developers, testers, database admin, etc. (stakeholders of software subsystem in Figure 1). However, unlike traditional software systems, key stakeholders are mostly from a mathematical/statistical background in an ML-based software system. These include but are not limited to Data Scientists, ML Developers, Ethics experts, Data Engineers, etc. (stakeholders of machine learning subsystem in Figure 1). Further, they can also include members from the operations team as well as software developers who develop components that consume the ML models. 2. Concerns: Each stakeholder may have one or more concerns that the system needs to address/satisfy. While the concerns of stakeholders of a traditional software system deal with choice of technologies, testing, fault tolerance, availability, security, etc., ML-based software system with an additional set of stakeholders brings in different concerns. These include data quality, ethics, data privacy, fairness, trustworthiness, ML models’ performance, etc. 3. Viewpoints: An architectural viewpoint is a collection of patterns, templates, and conventions for creating a view [14]. Such a view can be used to represent the concerns of one or more stakeholders of the system. In an ML-based software system, many involved stakeholders with varying skill sets require the architect to use multiple viewpoints to capture the different concerns. For instance, it might be required to create a learning viewpoint to support the construction of a view to represent the machine learning flow, machine learning components, etc. This view can then capture the concerns of the different stakeholders like ML developers, data scientists, ethics experts, etc. Further, a data viewpoint might be required to build a view to represent the data components, model the data pipeline, etc., that capture the concerns of stakeholders like data engineers, data scientists, etc. These different stakeholders, concerns, and viewpoints in ML- based software systems give rise to three key potential open research areas that require the attention of members from both the software architecture as well as the ML community.

One of the challenges in architecting ML-based software systems, or any software systems in general, is equipping the systems with the ability to evolve. As we have pointed above, in ML-based systems, this evolution (apart from the software side) can primarily arise from two important drivers, which include data and algorithm. However, more research needs to be done on: i) how such evolution can be managed or how to better architect ML-based systems that can cope with the fluctuating demands of data and constantly evolving ML techniques. ii) how to evolve a legacy software system to ML-based software systems. In such evolution, how to better handle existing team dynamics, technology constraints, organizational constraints, business requirements, etc. iii) the tools/frameworks that architects can leverage to better consider an architecture runway that supports the constantly evolving requirements of an ML-based software system.
