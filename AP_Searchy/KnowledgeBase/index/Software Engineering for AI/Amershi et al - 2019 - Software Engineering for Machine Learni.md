They developed systematic processes by adopting combo-flighting techniques (i.e., flighting a combination of changes and updates), including multiple metrics in their ex- periment score cards, and performing human-driven evaluation for more sensitive data categories. One respondent’s team uses “score cards for the evaluation of flights and storing flight information: How long has it been flighted, metrics for the flight, etc.” Automating tests is as important in machine learning as it is in software engineering; teams create carefully put-together test sets that capture what their models should do. However, it is important that a human remains in the loop. One respondent said, “we spot check and have a human look at the errors to see why this particular category is not doing well, and then hypothesize to figure out problem source.”

Fast-paced model iterations require more frequent deploy- ment. To ensure that system deployment goes smoothly, sev- eral engineers recommend not only to automate the training and deployment pipeline, but also to integrate model building with the rest of the software, use common versioning reposi- tories for both ML and non-ML codebases, and tightly couple the ML and non-ML development sprints and standups.
