. Although a large  number of organizations have adopted agile practices, these  approaches are often criticized of being applicable primarily  to small teams and organizations rather than large enterprises  with several hundreds of development teams [1]. In an  attempt to scale the advantages of these new methodologies,  a new model -commonly known as the Scaled Agile  Framework (SAFe), has been developed ([2,3]).

number of  companies have applied the framework and published their  experiences as technical reports [12], [13], [14]. These  reports state improvements in several directions such as  higher ROI, 20-30% faster time to market, 40-50% decrease  in post release defects, better alignment with customer needs,  and increase in productivity of 20-50%, within short periods  of time, i.e. in the order of months.

program level is to organize the  agile teams at scale in order to optimize the value delivery of  requirements. Furthermore, the program level also aligns the  teams with a strategic vision and roadmap for each  investment theme. At this level, business and architectural  features are defined and prioritized in the program backlog.  A major concept introduced at this level is the agile release  train (ART), which provides cadence and synchronization.  The ART produces releases or potentially shippable  increments (PSI) at fixed time boundaries, typically 60 to  120 days [2]. The releases are planned during a two-days  release planning event, which involves all relevant  stakeholders. Furthermore, a system team is formed in order  to establish an initial infrastructure and to support continuous  integration and end-to-end testing efforts.

portfolio level is needed for large enterprises, which  require governance and management models. The essence  lies in achieving a balance between four potentially  conflicting goals [11]:  • maximizing the financial value of the portfolio by  identifying value streams using Kanban systems,  • linking the portfolio to the strategy of an  organization through investment themes,  • ensuring that the scope of activities is feasible by  measuring appropriate metrics, and  • balancing the portfolio on relevant dimensions by  defining and managing business and architectural  epics, which run across value streams.

- ## Team

team level of the framework consists of agile teams,  which are collectively responsible for defining, building and  testing software in fixed-length iteration and releases. The  SAFe framework on this level contains a blend of agile  project management practices (Scrum) and agile technical  practices (XP). For instance, the concept of user stories is  borrowed from XP, while sprint planning, daily stand-ups  are typical Scrum components. ‘Definition of done’ and  retrospectives are adopted at each iterations. Teams operate  on an identical cadence and iteration lengths in order to  provide better integration among teams. These agile teams  typically consist of 7±2 team members [2].

The SAMI model is structured into four components:  agile levels, agile principles, agile practices and concepts,  and indicators [9]. Driven from the four values and twelve  principles of the Agile Manifesto, the SAMI model defines  five agile levels. Collaboration is one of the essential values  and qualities of agile and thus it is enumerated as Level 1.  Developing software through an evolutionary approach is  the next key principle in agile and the objective at Level 2 in  SAMI. Effectiveness and efficiency in developing high  quality, working software is the objective at Level 3. The key  objective at Level 4 is to gain the capability to respond to  change through multiple levels of feedback. Establishing a  vibrant and all-encompassing environment to sustain agility  is the objective at Level 5.
