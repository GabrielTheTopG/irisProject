The company chose VGT because of its ability to automate high system-level test cases, which previous automation techniques, e.g. unit testing [2], [3] and record and replay (R&R) [4]â€“[6], have had shortcomings in their ability to achieve. High system-level tests developed with automated unit tests have become both costly and complex, thereby spurring a discussion if the technique is applicable for anything but the low system-level testing, for which it was developed [7]
