A post-release defect is  a user reported problem in a software release, which  needs to be fixed. PRDD is defined as the total number  of user reported defects per thousand lines of code for  a delivered software release. It is one of the most  important and common measures of the quality of the  released software version from both developers and  users points of view. High defect density is likely to  cause low user satisfaction.
