Keyword-based test automation is the best solution for most software maintenance environments. The principal feature of the keyword-based approach is the separation of test engineering tasks into a set of roles. The keyword based approach provides a methodology and technology for each role. The roles include the test designer, the automation engineer, and the test executor. The roles can be combined if the individuals have the required skills. To form test cases in the keyword-based approach, a set of actions (i.e. keywords, business process events, etc.) are defined by the test designer and then documented in a spreadsheet or table with other keywords, input data, and expected results. The automation engineer codes up the keywords in the scripting language of the tool and the test executor runs the tests directly from the spreadsheet.
