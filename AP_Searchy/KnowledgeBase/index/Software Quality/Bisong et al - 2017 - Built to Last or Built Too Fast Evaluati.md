Developers tend to lose focus and productivity while waiting for code to build [6]. Such distraction has a detrimental effect to the idea of continuous integration that advocates for frequent builds to commit changes to the central codebase fast and early. However, as the projects expands, frequent integration can become a huge impedance to productivity. For example, if a build takes approximately 1 hour or more, integrating more than once a day can become a setback to developer speed and efficiency.
