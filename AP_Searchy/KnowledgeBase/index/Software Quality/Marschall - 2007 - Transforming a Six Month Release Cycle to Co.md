To enforce sufficient test coverage for every story  we introduced a quality gate. We ensured that our  goals for required test coverage were met by creating  automated reports from the unit test coverage tool  EMMA [2]. Additionally we required that all changed  code must be free of any serious bugs found by the  automated FindBugs tool [3]. We made one team  member responsible for merging Done user stories to  the release trunk. This person is responsible for  verifying these quality metrics and only merges a story  onto the trunk if all of them are met.
