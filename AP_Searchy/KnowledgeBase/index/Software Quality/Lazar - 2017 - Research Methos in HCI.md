critical usability incidents and  posting of usability problems to online forums have been shown to be effective for  identifying usability problems, although at a lower rate than in-person usability tests  (Andreasen et al., 2007; Bruun et al., 2009). Such studies also have the advantage  of being potentially asynchronousâ€”you might ask participants to complete tasks at  their convenience, reporting usability problems as appropriate.
