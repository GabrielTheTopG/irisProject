In this paper, we have proposed two techniques (i.e., segmentation and stack-trace analysis) to deal with these two issues. First, we divide the corpus extracted from each source code file into a series of segments and use the segment having the highest similarity with the bug report to substitute the file. Second, we identify names of explicitly-described possible faulty files in bug reports and provide more favor to these files and files directly related to these files. W
