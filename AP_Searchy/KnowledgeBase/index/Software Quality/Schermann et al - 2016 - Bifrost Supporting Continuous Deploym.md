A wide range of technical and business metrics need to be constantly moni- tored and compared to a known baseline for deviations. If runtime bugs, performance regressions, or unsatisfying A/B testing results are detected, a suitable fix (e.g., a rollback, or a hotfix) needs to be triggered, and if the metrics are positive, a further rollout should be considered.
