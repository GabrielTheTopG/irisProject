In addition, most existing research ignores the  seasonal work patterns that many software projects  follow, due to their regular releases. Past research shows  that ARIMA models are adequate for short-term  predictions, without considering seasonality. In this paper  we investigate whether an ARIMA model could be  constructed to adequately predict the long-term  fluctuation of all change requests for a project having  seasonal patterns.
