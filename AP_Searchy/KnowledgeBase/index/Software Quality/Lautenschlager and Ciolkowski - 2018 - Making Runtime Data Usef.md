We built up a tool chain to collect necessary runtime data that every single service produces: metrics (i.e., numeric values measured at regular intervals like memory usage), log events (i.e., information provided by logging) and traces (i.e., information to understand how a request was processed). Each of them is collected, stored and analyzed in a separate tool (see Fig. 2): We use Prometheus with Grafana for metrics; Fluentd, Elasticsearch and Kibana for log events; and Zipkin for distributed traces.
