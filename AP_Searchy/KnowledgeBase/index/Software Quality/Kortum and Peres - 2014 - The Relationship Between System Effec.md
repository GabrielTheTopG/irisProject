One of the more popular and well-researched instruments is the System Usability Scale (SUS; Brooke, 1996). It too is tech- nology agnostic and has the advantage of being relatively short (10 questions) so that it can be administered easily, even for multiple task scenarios. The SUS also has a significant amount of benchmark data available for a wide range of interfaces (Bangor, Kortum, & Miller, 2008; Kortum & Bangor, 2013; Sauro, 2011) allowing practitioners and researchers to compare their results with other similar kinds of products.
