A tool which is implemented based on the QAMs plays a significant role in popularizing a model. It is used to facilitate automatic quality evaluation. However, the results show that most of the selected studies did not provide a tool to support the automatic assessment.

Only a small portion of the selected studies provide a tool to implement the automatic assessment. Among these tools, many of them are not widely used in the industrial environ- ment. This may imply that these tools do not well satisfy industrial environment requirement. Further investigations or real-world case studies should be performed to address this question.
