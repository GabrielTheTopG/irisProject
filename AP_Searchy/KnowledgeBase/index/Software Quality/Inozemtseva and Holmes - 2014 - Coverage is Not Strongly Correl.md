In general, there is a low to moderate correlation be- tween the coverage of a test suite and its effectiveness when its size is controlled for. • The strength of the relationship varies between software systems; it is therefore not generally safe to assume that effectiveness is strongly correlated with coverage. • The type of coverage used had little impact on the strength of the correlation.
