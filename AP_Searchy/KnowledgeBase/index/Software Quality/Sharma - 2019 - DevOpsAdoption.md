End-users. An end-user is anyone who uses the application that is being  delivered. They are different from customers because they may not be  the ones who are generating any direct revenue for the organization (see  definition 2, “Customers/clients”). For example, for social media apps  like Facebook, Twitter, or Pinterest, the end-users do not pay to use the  service. While these companies may monetize the data they collect as  a result of these end-users utilizing their services, their real customers  are the ones who pay for their services. These end-users themselves may  be multiple sub-segments based on demographics, geography, usage  level, and so on

The distinction between end-user and customer is something that  confuses many people. Let’s look at a company like YouTube. An end- user is anyone who views or even posts videos. However, YouTube also  has a segment of end-users who are power-users. These users post  videos that get so many views that they are able to participate in a  revenue-sharing program with YouTube. As a result, these end-users  should definitely be considered a separate customer segment. Whether  YouTube considers them end-users or customer-clients depends on their  classification approach
