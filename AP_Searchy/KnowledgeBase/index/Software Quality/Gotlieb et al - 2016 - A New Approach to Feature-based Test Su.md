A crucial objective in SPLT then becomes to identify a test suite that optimizes reaching a specific goal (lower test duration or cost), while preserving full feature coverage.

A crucial objective in SPLT then becomes to identify a test suite that optimizes reaching a specific goal (lower test duration or cost), while preserving full feature coverage. In this paper, we revisit this problem with a new approach based on constraint optimization with a special constraint called GLOBAL CARDINALITY and a sophisticated search heuristic. This constraint enforces the coverage of all features through the compu- tation of max flows in a network flow representing the coverage relation.
