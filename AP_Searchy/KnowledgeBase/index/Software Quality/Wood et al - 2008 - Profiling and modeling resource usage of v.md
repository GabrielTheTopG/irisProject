It is impossible to tell if an application’s workload has a feedback loop just by looking at resource utilization traces of the original application. So the estimated resource utilization produced by our model for the application with a “feedback loop” might be higher than in reality since such an application might consume CPU resources in virtualized environment “slower” than in native one due to the increased latency on the application’s critical path.
