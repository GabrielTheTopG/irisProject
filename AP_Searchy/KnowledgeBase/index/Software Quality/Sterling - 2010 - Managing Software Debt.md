Lowering quality lengthens development time. The revisions of and responses to this sentence provided further clarity. There was also plenty of discussion about whether “quality” or “integrity” is the focal point and if the word law is appropriate. This kind of discussion is just up my alley, but I am going to focus on one particular point in the online conversation that links to a page on “Technical Debt”: Lowering quality lengthens development time in the long run, but can shorten development time in the short run if you’re starting from a good place. It’s a trick that you get to pull once, or maybe twice, before [technical debt] builds to the point of slowing down development. I’ve been part of pulling this trick a couple of times, when “making the numbers this quarter” at a startup had particularly high stakes.2
