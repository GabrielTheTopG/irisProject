Two sources of requirements changes were mentioned, namely requested changes that are formally approved (F14:50), but also changes that occur as the development process progresses (during design, development etc.) that are not raised as formal change requests (F5:82, F5:91, F11:38). When the requirements documentation is not reliable, the projects depend on individuals for correct requirements information.
