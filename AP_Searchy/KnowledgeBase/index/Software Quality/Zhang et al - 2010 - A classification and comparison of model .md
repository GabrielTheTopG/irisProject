Arcade (Barber et al., 2001) applies model checking to DRA (domain reference architecture) to provide software archi- tects early feedbacks on safety and liveness properties

n Perry and Wolf (1992) properties are used to constrain the choice of architectural elements, that is, to define constraints on the elements to the degree desired by the architect.

Model checking probabilistic SA properties: Model checking prob- abilistic SA properties (Grunske, 2008; Zhang et al., 2009; Grunske and Zhang, 2009) is also an interesting future work, since probabi- listic properties are considered the most important requirements for software in medical, avionic, automotive and telecommunica- tion systems. These probabilistic properties are required to express non-functional requirements such as availability, reliability, safety, security, and performance.
