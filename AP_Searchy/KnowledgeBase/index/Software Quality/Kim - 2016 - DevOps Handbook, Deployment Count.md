high performers had lead times measured in minutes or hours, while low performers had lead times measured in weeks, months, or even quarters.

We have decisive evidence of the business value of DevOps. From 2013 through 2016, as part of Puppet Labs’ State Of DevOps Report, to which authors Jez Humble and Gene Kim contributed, we collected data from over twenty-five thousand technology professionals, with the goal of better understanding the health and habits of organizations at all stages of DevOps adoption. The first surprise this data revealed was how much high-performing organizations using DevOps practices were outperforming their non–highperforming peers in the following areas:

market share, and profitability goals (two times more likely to exceed)

The 2015 State of DevOps Report examined not only “deploys per day” but also “deploys per day per developer.” We hypothesized that high performers would be able to scale their number of deployments as team sizes grew.Figure 1. Deployments/day vs. number of developers (Source: Puppet Labs, 2015 State Of DevOps Report.) ‡‡ Indeed, this is what we found. Figure 1 shows that in low performers, deploys per day per developer go down as team size increases, stays constant for medium performers, and increases linearly for high performers. In other words, organizations adopting DevOps are able to linearly increase the number of deploys per day as they increase their number of developers, just as Google, Amazon, and Netflix have done.
