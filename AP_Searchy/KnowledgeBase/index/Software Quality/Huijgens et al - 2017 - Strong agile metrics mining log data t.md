Average lead time is negatively impacted by  unplanned new work (e.g. incidents) (bottom row), possibly  because it delays planned work that was already started in the current sprint or earlier and that cannot finish in the planned time.  Average lead time is not tightly linked to a sprint, but more to a  user story.
