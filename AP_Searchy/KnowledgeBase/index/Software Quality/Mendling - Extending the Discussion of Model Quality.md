conceptual modeling, e.g., based on action theory [14], semiotics [9, 10] or cognitive theory [15], we deemed ontology- based theories (e.g., [16]) a most suitable starting point

fundamental principles underlying modeling have been discussed, among others, from the perspective of ontology (cf. e.g. [3]), metamodeling (cf. [4]), or epis- temology (cf. e.g. [5]). These different disciplines have provided some answers to the questions on what, how, and why something has to be captured in a model

ontology-based theory of representation that serves as a reference framework to our discussion. We selected the Bunge-Wand-Weber representation model motivated by its wide-spread adoption [12].

#BungeWandWeber #Representation #Model #Notation #Languages #Notations  #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
one of three theoretical models defined by Wand and Weber [18]

The representation model serves as an ontological model that characterizes real-world phenomena in information sys- tems domain that modelers may seek to have represented in their conceptual model

It articulates a set of necessary and sufficient constructs to represent any real-world phe- nomenon a user might choose [19].

Wand and Weber [8, 18] suggest that ontology can be used to help define and build models of information systems that contain the necessary rep- resentations of real world constructs

ontological reference systems provide sets of representation concepts to faithfully articulate real-world phe- nomena, they usually fail to describe how the set of representation concepts should be arranged (or composed together) in order to arrive at meaningful and moreover pur- poseful articulations of real-world phenomena.

The use of ontology for the purpose of asserting modeling quality, however, has been critiqued of recent years, for instance, with respect to the lack of pragmatic9 aspects in ontology-based studies [35].

We showed how traditional notions of model quality (such as completeness and clarity of the resulting model) have to be put in perspective in accordance to modeling pragmatics as well as the characteristics and competencies of the modeling individual

- ## Bunge

developed and refined a set of models based on an ontology defined by Bunge [17] for the evaluation of modeling techniques

attempts of establishing quality criteria for modeling include the guidelines of modeling [29]. This approach, however, lacks a sound theoretical methodology, and provides only limited empirical proof as to its feasibility as a quality framework [30].

especially pragmatic aspects of modeling have so far only scarcely been addressed in related research [6].

Lindland et al. discuss [9] in their framework the assertion of model quality on a pragmatic level, however, the notion of pragmatics is reduced to the correspondence between a model and its interpretation (whether a model can be understood by its audience).

Little research has comprehensively investigated the notion of model quality [6]. Inter- esting is the work of Lindland et al. [9] who developed an understanding of conceptual model quality based on semiotic theory

fundamental constructs of the representation theory can be found elsewhere (e.g. [8, 18, 19]).

mapping has a reduction feature, i.e., the model includes only a subset of properties4 of the original

Stachowiak’s general model theory [20] to further elaborate on this point. Generally speaking, a model can be understood as an abstraction of a real or language- based system (cf. e.g. [4]). According to Stachowiak [20], a model possesses three fea- tures.

mapping feature. Since a model can be regarded as a language-based system there must be a relation between it and the “original” system. A consequence of this perception is that a model has characteristics of a role

- ## Stachowiak

model is created with certain pragmatics in mind. There- fore, the model and the “original” system need to be consistent with respect to those characteristics that are relevant for the purpose of the model.
