Model-to-Model (M2M) transformations evolve a PIM  into a PSM. Last, Model-to-Text (M2T) transformations are  used to generate the executable system from the PSM. This  step includes generating several code artifacts glued to- gether: Java business classes, Oracle DB schemas, etc.

We will show in the paper that most current  MDD approaches only focus on system functional require- ments when generating system models, not integrating NFRs  into the MDD process. Disregarding NFRs will usually pro- voke that the generated system does not completely satisfy  some (if not all) of the stakeholders’ expectations repre- sented by NFRs

Being true that the specifities of each NFR type  makes it difficult to treat them uniformily, it is also clear  that we need to be able to reconcile them since the generated  system needs to fulfil all of them together. (d) The  framework presented here conceives the application of  transformation (and thus obtention of models) top-down  with respect to abstraction level. However, this does not  need to be always this way. For instance, a technological  NFR fixing the brand and release of the data base product  will have an implicit consequence on some other more  abstract model, namely to know that a data base of a  particular type (relational, OOR, …) has to be integrated  into e.g. the development view of the architecture
