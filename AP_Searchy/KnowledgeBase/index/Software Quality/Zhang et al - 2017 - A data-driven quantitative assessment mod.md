Data resources that are mostly from GPS [18], GIS [19], Taximeter and Float car data [20]. For example, GPS data collected in Berlin for one entire week provide clear demonstration of the variation in taxi demand [21]. Therefore, we designed this evaluation model based on data collected from GPS and taximeter.

Lerner index [30] or combining static and dynamic datasets [31]. For electric vehicle industry, indicators include perfor- mance in other areas such as social welfare and transportation efficiency [32]. In the field of business ecosystem, criteria set can be derived from areas of robustness, productivity and niche creation [11]. A Bhealthy^ industry must reach a dynam- ic equilibrium among organization structure, productivity and robustness [33].

Robustness: Companies within the industry are well-orga- nized, operating in good condition. The amount of reve- nue can be estimated correctly, and almost every big os- cillation can be predicted. & Productivity: Companies within the industry are capable of maintaining a balance of demand and supply, and re- sources are utilized efficiently. & Sustainability: Companies within the industry can reach a balanced budget at least, and the income of the drivers is guaranteed. Besides, both energy used and carbon should be kept to a reasonable level.

Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) is described as a methodological tool for modeling and solving complex prob- lems [39]. Decision-makers from both public and private sec- tors participate in decision-making process [40]. MCDM is one of the helpful evaluation techniques in public transporta- tion system, which can integrate the stakeholders’ opinions in decision process [41].

For multi-criteria decision making process, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is based on pair-wise compari- sons of criteria to establish the weights [51]. It’s the only known MCDM model that can provide a method of the consistency in the decision maker’s decisions [52]. The three steps are as follows.

The term BBusiness Ecosystem^ means a network of actors interact with each other with an essential technology for survival and success [10], the health of which are shown in its longevity and grow- ing propensity [11].
