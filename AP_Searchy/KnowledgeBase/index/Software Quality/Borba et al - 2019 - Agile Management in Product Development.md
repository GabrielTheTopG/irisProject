Cooper  and Sommer, in their 2016 article,  reported that Scrum was used for all the  case studies they had explored. Sommer  and coauthors, in a 2015 RTM article  reporting on an empirical study of five  companies using hybrid processes, iden- tified Scrum as the method adopted by  all five companies. The companies  adopted Stage-Gate at the strategic level  and Scrum practices at the execution  level. Scrum tools such as time-boxed  sprints, stand-up meetings, retrospec- tive meetings, backlogs, and scrum  boards were used within each stage, to  accelerate development and add  flexibility.
