Formal software requirements tracing helps to  systematically determine the impact of changes and to keep track of develop- ment artifacts that need to be re-tested when requirements change. However,  full tracing of all requirements on the most detailed level can be very expensive  and time consuming. In the paper an initial “tracing activity model” is intro- duced along with a framework that allows measuring the expected cost and  benefit of tracing approaches.
