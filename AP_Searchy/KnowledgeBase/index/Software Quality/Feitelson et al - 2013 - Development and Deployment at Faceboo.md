Two kinds of rollback  exist: The typical rollback reverts a single com- mit and any dependencies (which are few or  nonexistent owing to the practice of small and  independent commits, as well as the high fre- quency of commits and pushes). A much rarer  rollback occurs when the entire binary must  revert to the previous working version.
