Even with quality dimensions derived from an international standard, quality indices calculated from source code measurements remain arbitrary as long as no comparison with other systems is available. To provide such information, SIG maintains a benchmark repository (Correia and Visser 2008a) holding the results from several hundreds of stan- dard system evaluations carried out so far.
