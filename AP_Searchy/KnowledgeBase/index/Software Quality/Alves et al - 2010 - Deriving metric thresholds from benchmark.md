We designed a method that determines metric thresholds empirically from measurement data. The measurement data for different software systems are pooled and aggregated after which thresholds are selected that (i) bring out the metricâ€™s variability between systems and (ii) help focus on a reasonable percentage of the source code volume. Our method respects the distributions and scales of source code metrics, and it is resilient against outliers in metric values or system size.
