Another similar approach to ours is that of Wagner [?]. He described an approach to express a quality model sim- ilar to the Quamoco model using Bayesian nets. He found that the structure of the quality model transforms well into a Bayesian net but the prediction results were mixed. A reduction of measures was not considered.

Our results from comparing the Quamoco base model to focused models built using machine learning show that it is possible to build an evaluation model only relying on 10 mea- sures while having a standardised accuracy of 61 %. The reduction from 378 measures in the comprehensive model to 10 measures facilitates the application in practice, because only 10 measures need to be calculated and, e.g., checked for false positives.

Our overall aim is to make the application of quality mod- els and their integration into the development process as simple and effortless as possible. To give immediate feedback to developers when quality problems have been introduced, we propose continuous quality control [?].

It in- cludes 378 maintainability-related measures and evaluates and aggregates them to a single grade for maintainability.
