Feature models can be extended with additional information by means of feature attributes, these are called attributed or extended feature models (Benavides et al., 2010). Feature attributes are often defined as tuples < name, value > specifying nonâ€“functional information of features such as cost or memory consumption.

Now we propose to measure the complexity of features in terms of the number of edges and constraints in which they are involved.
