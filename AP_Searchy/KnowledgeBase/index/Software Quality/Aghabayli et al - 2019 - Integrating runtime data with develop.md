Objectives of Data Understanding were to gain an overview of the available software quality data in the context of the ACME project, to understand the data, and to identify possibilities to integrate it for the purpose of analysis. In the first step, we identified potentially relevant data sets and features within each set. Next, we assessed the quality of the relevant data and identified quality issues we needed to address prior to the analysis. Relevant Data Sets. The relevant, in the scope of the research, data sets collected from the ACME project were grouped into ex- ternal and internal quality aspects as follows: • External quality data sets, collected from the runtime of the software: – Access logs: all HTTP server access requests of the project. The data were collected from the Amazon CloudWatch platform. – Error logs: all HTTP server errors of the project. The data were collected from the Amazon CloudWatch platform.

Regarding our second hypothesis, the correlation between the number of occurred bugs and the number of rule violations was -0.41. Surprisingly, the result indicates a moderate negative correla- tion between the data sets,
