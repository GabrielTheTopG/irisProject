Our approach is that system test of this class of applications requires the following functional models: • Hierarchy of functions: a list of functions derived through a hierarchical decomposition of the specification; • Processes: business processes flowing through a number of functions of the hierarchy; • States and transitions of application objects: an application object changes its state through the execution of functions of the hierarchy. The state and the possible transitions between states act as constraints on business processes. Each model may be implemented with specific modeling lan- guages and may be tested choosing the most suitable testing tech- niques.

This paper presents a study to support the choice of the best strategy (according to cost/benefit criteria) for the system test of a specific – but widely used – class of software applications
