. In this paper we have presented an automatic method for generating feature usage scenarios. The method works by systemat- ically exploring the event and value space of the application. In order to create high-coverage scenarios we utilize techniques such as symbolic execution, and dependency tracking. In order to reduce the number of generated scenarios, we analyze the relationships between the scenarios and features, and remove all non- related scenarios. We also subsume scenarios based on their coverage.
