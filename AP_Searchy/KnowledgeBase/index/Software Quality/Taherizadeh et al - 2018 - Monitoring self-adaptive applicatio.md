To adapt edge computing applications to the changing execu- tion environment and ensure application QoS requirements con- tinue to be satisfied, it is necessary to employ a comprehensive monitoring system able to address the whole spectrum of re- quirements, pertaining to different levels including (1) the un- derlying infrastructures (e.g. VM’s computing resources, etc.), (2) edge computing platforms (e.g. Docker containers, etc.), (3) net- work connections between individual application components and (4) application-specific measurements (e.g. service response time, etc.).
