The lack of integration of NFRs with functional requirements can result in long time-to-market and cost overruns in software projects [20], [25], [26], [27]. Indeed, some researchers have already reported that the notion of NFR is not always clear for practitioners (e.g., Ameller et al. [28]).

The common approach, in the state of the art, is to add NFRs to models by using UML profiles and, in fewer cases, NFRs are added directly to the UML models (e.g., as a comment) or by providing a whole metamodel designed for this objective [29].

NFRs have lower priority than functional requirements. The reason argued by the respondents is that NFRs, such those related to usability, are not considered in the early stages of development. This fact is sup- ported by our study results. As reported in Finding 5, the NFRs that are difficult to specify through models are often handled by modifying the generated code or even validated during the final stages.

NFRs are more difficult to discover. The main problem with NFRs is that many of them remain undiscov- ered or in non-measurable terms. This opinion is also given by software architects [28] who declare NFRs as difficult to elicit upfront. Recent approaches suggest using data-driven methods to facilitate this elicitation [61] if the system already produces data. New proposals capable of automatically generating NFRs, as the one presented in [62], may change the perception of the importance of NFRs.

In other words, we think that complex requirements such as NFRs, which have fundamentally a cross-cutting nature, are difficult to quantify, and are highly interrelated with each other, may be difficult to handle systematically and may require a specific treatment

However, software products need to be compliant with all types of requirements and MDD seems to be not ready for such diversity of needs. In particular, the study has shown that software engineers expect MDD bringing benefits for some particular types of NFRs related to the development process, while companies adopt MDD approaches mainly to better support NFRs related to the system behaviour.

The ISO/IEC 25010 standard [24] is arguably the most widespread classification used. It has to be noted that seven out of the eight main software product quality categories defined by ISO/IEC 25010 are dealing with NFRs, e.g., performance efficiency, compatibility, security to mention just a few. Furthermore, these seven categories provide over 30 subcategories for NFRs.
