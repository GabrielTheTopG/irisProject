Incremental build jobs vary in terms of duration. Unfortu- nately, modern build tools do not provide a forecast of how long a job will take. Without forecasts, developers may make costly, unnecessary context switches (e.g., when the build job completes within seconds or minutes) or may wait for a build job to complete when a context switch would have been more prudent (e.g., when the build job takes hours to complete).
