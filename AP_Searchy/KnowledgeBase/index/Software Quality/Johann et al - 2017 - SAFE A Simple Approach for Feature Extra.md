In this paper, we presented a simple approach for feature extraction (SAFE) from both app pages and user reviews. We call it simple because it neither requires an a priori training with a large dataset nor a configuration of machine learning features and parameters. The SAFE approach performs a comprehensive preprocessing of the natural language input, applies Part-of- Speech and sentence patterns to extract human readable features and finally matches the features from app reviews to the features extracted in the related app page.
