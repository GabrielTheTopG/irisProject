To make test suites automatically executable, each step is equipped with an automation. A common approach is to define step automations declaratively in form of sequences of interactions with the systemâ€™s user interface. Those sequences are not executable themselves, but have to be interpreted by a testing tool. Many test automation tools provide reuse mechanisms to extract parts of interaction sequences (similar to reuse components for test procedures). Figure 3 shows an example of an interaction sequence in the test automation tool Ranorex1.
