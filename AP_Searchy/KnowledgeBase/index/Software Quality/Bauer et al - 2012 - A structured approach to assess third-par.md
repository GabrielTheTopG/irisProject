Included libraries can significantly impact the maintainability of a software system. Often, projects use a number of different libraries and the code is highly entangled with their APIs. This poses multiple risks to the evolution of the software. First, libraries continuously evolve. New releases provide added function- ality and bug fixes. In many cases, it is desirable to migrate a software system to the latest stable release of a library, especially in case of critical bugs such as security flaws. However, migration can cause considerable maintenance ef- fort, as backward-compatibility may not always be ensured. Second, a library might be still unstable and introduce bugs into the software, which could be difficult to find and hard to fix. Third, the providerâ€™s support or maintenance of a library might be discontinued, such that the library consumer can no longer expect fixes for critical bugs. Finally, the license of a library or the legal constraints in a project may change, forcing the project to stop employing the library.
