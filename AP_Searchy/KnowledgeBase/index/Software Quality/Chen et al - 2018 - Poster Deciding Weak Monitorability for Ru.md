n important problem in runtime verification is monitorability [1, 3, 6]. Note that runtime verification checks whether a property is satisfied or violated after observing a finite trace. We say a property is monitorable if the satisfaction or violation of the property will Permission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

However, note that a property usually specifies the admissible infinite traces of the system under consideration
