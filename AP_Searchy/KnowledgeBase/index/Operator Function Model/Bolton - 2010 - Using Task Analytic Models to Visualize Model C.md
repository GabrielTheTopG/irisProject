formal system model  implemented in the language of the Symbolic Analysis Laboratory  (SAL). This allows us to use model checking formal verification to  evaluate human-automation interaction. In this paper we present  an operational concept and design showing how our task modeling  visual notation

human task models are created using an inter­ mediary language called Enhanced Operator Function Model  (EOFM) [7], [8], an XML-based, generic human task modeling  language based on the Operator Function Model (OFM) [9],  [10].

designing for human-automation interaction (HAl),  human factors engineers generally do not use formal models  (see [2] for a review of the ways formal methods have been  used to analyze HAl), but rather task analytic methods to  represent human behaviors

Our counterexample visualization prototype is implemented  in Microsoft Visio and Visual Basic for Applications. With an  instantiated EOFM and a text file containing a SAL produced  counterexample as input, the software identifies variables that  represent the human task behavior model

Our visualization was explicitly designed to help analysts  interpret counterexamples. However, such a visualization may  be useful for debugging models during development.

Model checking has been used successfully to find interac­ tion errors in computer hardware and software applications.  However, one source of failures in complex, safety critical  systems is the interaction between the human operator and  other system components.

Task analytic models represent  descriptive and normative human behavior as sequences of  activities with respect to the fulfillment of goals [3], [4].
