Activity decomposition includes the following set of  relationships: SEQ, AND, XOR, OR. A sequence relationship  (SEQ) between two activities at the same level of  decomposition is seen frequently, but modelers should be wary  about overusing this relationship. Many activities that appear  sequential are not required to be performed sequentially

operator function model is one of the new set of models  whose intent is to describe andor prescribe the role of the  operator in increasingly complex systems. The goal of the  OFM is to create a compact, dynamic description of operator  activities based on a visual representation of these activities.

#Characteristics #OFM #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
The operator function model is an operator, as opposed to a  system, model

structure  is both heterarchic and hierarchic. Heterarchies represent  altemative or concurrent solutions. Hierarchies are  decompositions that correspond to various levels of abstraction  in the problem analysis

operational heuristics,  that is, rules of thumb or background knowledge, which are not  represented in the operator function model.

OFMspert is a form of intent inferencing (e.g., Rubin, Jones, &  Mitchell, 1988) or activity tracking (Callantine, Mitchell, &  Palmer, 1998).

- ## Intent
#Intent #Inferencing #OFM #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
What is the operator doing? Why is the operator  doing that? What will the operator do next? Readers might note  that the questions posed above are the complement of Wiener's  (1989) famous characterization of questions that pilots often  ask about flight deck automation

OFMspert is a computational and dynamic representation of the  operator function model. Given the current system state,  previous operator actions, and overall system goals, OFMspert  predicts operator activitie,s and attempts to interpret detected  operator actions as supponting one or more predicted activities.
