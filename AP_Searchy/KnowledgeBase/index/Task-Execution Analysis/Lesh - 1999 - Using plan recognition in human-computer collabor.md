Plan recognition (e.g., [3, 11]) is the term generally given to the process of inferring intentions from actions.

According to SharedPlan theory, a key component of the mental state of each participant in a collaboration is a set of beliefs about the mutually believed goals and actions to be performed, and about the mutually believed capabilities, intentions, and commitments of each participant

Of course, the focus of attention does not guarantee a unique explanation. When ambi- guity arises, we choose between two options: either wait or ask for clarification. A reason to wait is that future actions might resolve the ambiguity. A reason to ask now is that a collab- orative system can be much more helpful when it knows what the user is doing. We believe it will be very difficult, in general, to compute the precise utility of asking for clarification
