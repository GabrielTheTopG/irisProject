nvisible tasks are such tasks that exist in a process model but not in its event log. It is a little difficult to mine them because they do not appear in any event trace of an event log.

The enactment services of processes (i.e., the execution engines of business process models) allow skipping or redoing current task and jumping to any previous task as a result of human interventions to improve the flexibility of execution [9].
