Ethically Aligned Design [4] refers to the involvement  of decision-making in practice and ethical consideration in  a the practice and design AI and autonomous systems and  technologies. Involving ethical consideration into the  context of software and interactive systems design has a  history of more than 30 years.

In this paper, we  empirically evaluate a method that enables ethically aligned  design in a decision-making process. Though this method,  titled the RESOLVEDD strategy, originates from the field of  business ethics, it is being applied in other fields as well. We  tested the RESOLVEDD strategy in a multiple case study of  five student projects where the use of ethical tools was given  as one of the design requirements. A key finding from the  study indicates that simply the presence of an ethical tool has  an effect on ethical consideration, creating more  responsibility even in instances where the use of the tool is  not intrinsically motivated.

The RESOLVEDD strategy is based on professional  ethics and approaches ethics from the point of view of  personal ethical problems in work contexts. It is not  connected to any particular ethics theory and it does not  enforce any set of values on its would-be users. Instead,  RESOLVEDD is intended to support its users in taking  into account ethical issues and tackling them through their  own set of values or through an ethics theory of their  choice. [16]
