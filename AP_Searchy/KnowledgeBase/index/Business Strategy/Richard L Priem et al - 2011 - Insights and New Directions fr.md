viewing consumer  preferences as dynamically changing and sometimes latent (e.g., Kirzner, 1997; i.e., just like  March & Simon’s, 1958, bounded rationality for managers, consumers have bounded  foreknowledge of their own needs), and (d) emphasizing product markets as key sources of  value-creation strategies for firms

his move toward more demand-pull  innovation research has been acclaimed as a paradigm shift away from the traditional producer  innovation model (Baldwin & von Hippel, 2010).

. Researchers have found that consumer users  are major drivers of innovation, especially in consumer goods sectors, and that firms  intentionally get consumers involved in their innovation processes (e.g., Franke & Shah,  2003; von Hippel, 2005; for a review see Bogers et al., 2010).

a consumer-oriented strategy for  innovation, demonstrating that demand landscapes can shape the opportunity structures for  firms’ innovations (e.g., Adner, 2002; Adner & Snow, 2010a, 2010b; Danneels, 2003, 2004,  2008).

Baldwin and von Hippel (2010) modeled the efficacy of  producer innovation versus user innovation (i.e., by individual firms or single individuals)  versus open innovation. Their model suggests that user and open innovation are playing an  increasingly important role in our economy

Demand-side studies are also clarifying the role of heterogeneous consumer needs as a  source of value-creating strategies for firms. A study by Schmidt and Keil (2010b) modeled  the more general case of customer-driven diversification based on unique demand-side  complementarities, where having multiple products on offer increases the customers’  willingness to pay. They found that firm market share and profitability differ consistently  across diversification types based on product scope versus demand complementarities

And firm–customer  integration also results in the coproduction of value-creating innovations (e.g., Franke &  Shah, 2003; Gruber et al., 2008; von Hippel, 2005) and spurs the identification of  entrepreneurial opportunities (Chatterji et al., 2008; Franke & Shah, 2003). F
