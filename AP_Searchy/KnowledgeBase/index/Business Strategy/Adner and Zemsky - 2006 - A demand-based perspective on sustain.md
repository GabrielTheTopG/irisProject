f disruptive tech- nologies (Christensen, 1997). Disruptions occur when existing industry boundaries are redrawn by the entry of firms using new technologies that start in a niche segment and, as they improve, displace incumbent technologies from mainstream segments. The recent technology bubble, in which many promising new technologies turned out not to be disruptive,

Subsequent work in this strand has tended to focus on the conditions that govern the ability of different parties to capture value (e.g., Lippman and Rumelt, 2003; MacDonald and Ryall, 2004). We complement this work by shifting attention toward the drivers of value creation.

dded-value approach to business strategy (Brandenburger and Stuart, 1996), seeks to leverage cooperative game theory. This literature starts with value creation by coalitions of different economic actors.

the added-value methodology (e.g., Brandenburger and Stuart, 1996), which assumes that a firmâ€™s ability to capture value is governed by its added value. In our analysis, we make the notion of competitive advantage precise by equating it with added value.

ssessment of how resources create value from a consumer perspective has received less attention. While the com- petitive strategy school has been more explicit in its treatment

This leads us to focus on demand- side drivers: marginal utility from performance improvements, consumer taste for quality, and the extent of consumer heterogeneity.
