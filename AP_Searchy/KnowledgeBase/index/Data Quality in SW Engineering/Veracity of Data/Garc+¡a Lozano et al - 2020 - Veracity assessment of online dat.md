Deep learning and transfer learning. Machine learning has, with recent years’ reemergence of deep learning, made giant leaps and has had unprecedented success in a number of fields. However, the use of deep learning techniques in the eval- uated paper set is very low, and a research gap is clearly present. This is also related to the previous point—the lack of suitable data sets—which further limits effective use of ma- chine learning.

Scalable online methods and data. Many of the used approaches and methods are theoretically scalable or applicable in an online setting. However, the majority of the reviewed papers’ results come from experiments which have not focused on scalability or streaming data. For a realistic open source data veracity assessment application, these two aspects (scalability and ability to handle streamed data) are probably crucial.

In this work we review the literature in search for methods and techniques representing state of the art with regard to computerized veracity assessment. We study what others have done within the area of veracity assessment, especially targeted towards social media and open source data, to understand research trends and determine needs for future re- search. The most common veracity assessment method among the studied set of papers is to perform text analysis using supervised learning. Regarding methods for machine learning much has happened in the last couple of years related to the advancements made in deep learning.

The concept of veracity was introduced and became widely used among computer scientists after it, in 2012, was proposed as the fourth “V” [18, 91, 96] (the other ones being Volume, Variety, and Velocity) of big data [57].

There are many more examples; Lukoianova and Rubin [68] propose a veracity framework with three main veracity dimensions outlined by “objectivity, truthfulness, credibility and their opposites,” and Ramachandramurthy et al. [83] state that veracity “focuses on Information Quality (IQ).” It is worth pointing out that many of the veracity aspects such as data quality, truth, credibility, and trustfulness assessment, were not new and had been addressed by researchers in related settings, e.g., decision support and information systems, before the big data inclusion in 2012 [2, 28, 70, 77, 104].

Another related veracity assessment concept is the indicator; an indicator is a predefined phenomenon of interest that may, or may not, be present in the data. The occurrences of one or several indicators can be used to facilitate the veracity assessment process. The indicators may also affect the confidence in an assessment positively or negatively. Indicators can also in themselves be assessed with regard to veracity. Whether a specific approach targets a single indicator or solves the whole veracity assessment problem is in many cases context-dependent: determining user credibility can for example both be a purpose in itself and be thought of as a veracity assessment indicator.
