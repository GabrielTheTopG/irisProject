Current project management systems deal with scheduling, resource and budget management, Data-Driven Elicitation, Assessment and Documentation of Quality Requirements 589etc., but they do not explicitly include support for QR management [18].

In summary, we advocate that the current state of the art calls for improved methods for the elicitation, assessment and documentation of QRs especially in ASD.
