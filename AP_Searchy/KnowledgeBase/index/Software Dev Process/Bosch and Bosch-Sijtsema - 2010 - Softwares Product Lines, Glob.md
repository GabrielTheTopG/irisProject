lthough collaboration has been compli- cated, several trends increase the complexity of managing dependencies between software development teams and organizations. These trends include the increasing adoption of software product lines, the globalization of software engineering and the increasing use of and reliance on 3rd party developers in the context of soft- ware ecosystems.

We define software ecosystem as follows: a software ecosystem consists of a software platform, a set of internal and external developers and a community of domain experts in service to a community of users that compose relevant solution elements to satisfy their needs. Once a product or family of products has become successful in the market, a significant business opportunity appears in the form of third party developer and customer contributions to the product (family).
