To overcome the heterogeneity of software analytics data coming from different sources, we follow an ontology-based data integra- tion approach in this paper; in particular, we intend to contribute: (a) the definition of an ontology capturing the semantics of relevant data for software analytics; (b) a current static approach for the integration of heterogeneous data sources given a set of predefined analytic views representing software quality factors;

. Despite these efforts, there are still challenges for companies developing commercial systems to understand how to integrate heterogeneous data sources for software analytics.

Previous research shows that relevant quality aspects (e.g., maintainability and reliability) contain metrics from heterogeneous data sources, i.e., from several classes of the ontology [17]. For this reason, we propose information requirements that consider several classes and help to reason over multiple metrics impacting a quality aspec

Also, after a commit, Static Code Analysis is automati- cally triggered, producing Code Quality Measures (e.g., cyclomatic complexity, lines of code) and checking Quality Rule Violations.

The different modules are studied with respect to changes, violations, and code metrics as measurements. Examples of action points to be taken by product owners are: allo- cating time in the next release to reduce the quality rule violations in a module
