In MDPD the validation of perceived value of developed functionality requires longer lead-times as well as different tools, for example GAP analysis, customer value analysis (CVA) and focus groups (Gorschek 2006).

The latest studies of requirements prioritisation practices applied in industry have revealed that having unclear procedures whenit comesto definition of requirements valueis not uncommon (Barney et al., 2006, Lehtola and Kauppinen 2006).

The common aspects of agile methods can be summarised by the following principles [hereafter called Agile Property (AP)] (Highsmith and Cockburn 2001, Abrahamsson et al., 2003, Cohen et al., 2004):

- ## Motivation
#Motivation #Scaling #Agile #Practices #Software #Product #Management 
AP1. Feature orientation: The main focus is on the production of features as soon as possible. The goal is to deliver working functionality that is perceived to have the most value for the customer, and this is done in small and frequent iterations.

- ## Motivation
#Motivation #Scaling #Agile #Practices #Software #Product #Management 
AP2. Reactive development: Reactive development is about responding to a change instead of planning ahead, and delaying decisions as long as possible. Agile methods promise flexibility and follow the ideology that one can not control the world, thus the strategy is to respond to a change rather than plan for it. Examples of reactive practices are refactoring, adjusting requirements priorities, and release scope after each iteration and delaying decisions for as long as possible.

- ## Motivation
#Motivation #Scaling #Agile #Practices #Software #Product #Management 
AP3. Evolving project (release) scope: Perhaps one of the main distinguishing features of agile development is the change from a fix-scope approach to a more open-ended approach. In the traditional fix-scope approach much effort is spent on defining and planning the content of a product release of a project upfront. In agile the release scope is emerging in the process of development rather than planned ahead. A prioritised list of requirements (product backlog in SCRUM and prioritised user stories in XP) serves as an initial input which is a kind of wish-list of a release scope. The release scope is expected to be refined and updated at the end of each iteration in order to accommodate changes and new information that was learned in the latest iteration. This practice is in line with the reactive development property described in AP2.

When it comes to MDPD, to the best of our knowledge and for the time being, studies focusing on understanding of the impact of agile principles on pre-project, product management activities do not exist. This situation indicates a critical gap in understanding, e.g. the long-term effects of agile methods on product development. This is especially relevant when considering MDPD, where pre-project activities are critical (Regnell et al., 2005).

Streamline is a process that tries to apply agile principles in an MDPD context. The process has clear characteristics of market-driven development, where requirements are collected from different sources and filtered through the pre-screening and prioritisation steps to produce the ‘Priority directive’ of a release. Streamline also has a strong connection to agile and lean development principles,

t while agile is appreciated in separate development projects (Karlstrom and Runeson 2005, Svensson and Host 2005, Petersen and Wohlin 2008) they are not directly suited or designed for long-term product planning and product management, thus there is a need to find a way to apply agile methods in development projects without disrupting product management operations

- ## Aspects

On the other hand, agile methods are designed to accommodate rapid change (Beck 2000, Williams and Cockburn 2003). In order to be flexible, agile methods rely on individuals and their knowledge rather than processes, value working piece of software over complete requirements specifications and design plans; and encourage responding to a change rather than planning for it (Manifesto for Agile Software Development 2008).

- ## Aspects
#Aspects  #Agility #Scaling #Agile #Practices #Software #Product #Management 
The intention in an agile project is not to have the best selection but to refine the scope during the course of development (Beck and Fowler 2001, Poppendieck and Poppendieck 2003, Williams and Cockburn 2003, Leffingwell 2007).

- ## Aspects

Understanding of value: Agile methods focus on creating rapid value for a specific customer. In MDPD the definition of what constitutes value is more complex and the potential value for a specific customer is just one component of a value measure

Application of agile properties in an organisation operating in market-driven context places limitations on product management activities, and may have a detrimental effect on long-term product development.

The most important aspects of MDPD are requirements triage (initial selection), requirements prioritisation and planning (release planning), i.e. deciding which of the thousands of potential requirements should be implemented, and when (Carlshamre 2002, Karlsson et al., 2003, Regnell et al., 2005). The main task of product management is to weigh all types of criteria ranging from market demands, trends, key-customer demands, to technical and long-term product impact,

Trade-off between market-pull and technology-push: Studies in relation to MDPD have shown that the development organisation not only needs to respond to the current consumer needs but also anticipate future needs as well as influence the needs of the consumers via inno- vations and technology breakthrough.

At this stage of the practiced process all products considered both commercial and technical requirements. When it comes to the question of balance between the commercial and technical requirements the inter- viewed system experts expressed their concern that system and architectural improvements were receiving less attention compared to commercial requirements

The problems of finding a balance between features and architecture improvements have been acknowledged and reported by other researchers (Wohlin and Aurum 2005) and are common to Market Driven Requirements Engineering (MDRE).

The components used as evaluation criteria are presented below following the order of their importance as defined by practitioners: (i) benefit (value) to company and alignment with product strategy; (ii) benefit (value) for potential customers; (iii) cost; (iv) how well the requirement improves non-functional characteristics.

In MDPD the priority and implementation order of a requirement is a function of the expected value and cost of a requirement, technical dependencies of a requirement and value dependencies between the requirements (Carlshamre 2002, Greer and Ruhe 2004, Saliu and Ruhe 2005, Ngo-The and Ruhe 2008).

DZAMASHVILI FOGELSTROM¨ ET AL. to a new development process was to minimise the number of change requests. Change requests were associated with high development costs since they often resulted in wasting development effort in form of detailed analysis of requirements that were not implemented in the final product or expenses associated with rework.
