we aim to make software analytics a core feedback loop for software engineering projects. CodeFeedr’s vision entails: (1) The ability to unify archival and cur- rent software analytics data under a single query language, and (2) The feasibility to apply new techniques and methods for high-level aggregation and summarization of near real-time information on software development

Extending the scope of productivity measurement. Most ap- proaches in this domain use only the outputs generated in the coding stage, usually in terms of Source Lines of Code (SLOC), functionalities or story points completed over time. However, we can get a better understanding of stakeholders’ work by looking at their interactions at a more detailed level and associating them to a speci"c stage in the software developmen

It is a challenging task to understand and measure the impact of changes over time. Furthermore, the possibility of introducing an unintended fault or defect during those changes is relatively high. This situation calls for urgent measures to im- prove source code visualization by aligning near real-time data from the software delivery pipeline with software quality factors and productivity analytics metrics

Prioritization of bug #xes. Crash reports produced during ex- ecution failures are very valuable for understanding and "xing software bugs. However, crash data might include a lot of noise, be incomplete, and hide important information hindering their analysis and comprehension. Therefore, several approaches try to interpret the messages that these reports convey to achieve accu- rate error recovery. However, nowadays, there is also a need for "xing software problems as soon as possible.

The development of CodeFeedr, a Real-time Software Analytics Platform represents our vision to tackle current challenges for mod- ern software projects. Our platform enables a real-time feedback loop environment in order to: (1) speed up decision-making, (2) monitor software development infrastructure in real-time and (3) create up-to-date customized information views of the software development work!ow.

The lack of end-to-end visibility of interdependent libraries. Dependencies in a dependency tree change and evolve indepen- dently. A dependency tree may look di#erent after a fresh build due to the !exible dependency constraints, for example semantic versioning ranges used in npm. A dependency can automatically in- clude a more recent version, that may add additional dependencies to the tree without the developer being aware of it
