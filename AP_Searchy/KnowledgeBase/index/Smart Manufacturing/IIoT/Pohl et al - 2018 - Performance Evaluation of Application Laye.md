This paper compares the performance of the protocols Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) and Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) in the context of a monitoring business application. For that purpose, a three-layered test-bed is designed with a variable latency and Packet-Loss-Rate (PLR). MQTT performs best regarding the characteristics bandwidth usage, reliability, latency and throughput. AMQP performs worse than MQTT comparing the bandwidth usage and throughput. In contrast, XMPP has the worst values in all categories.

Considered characteristics are bandwidth usage, reliability, latency and throughput of the protocols. In the following section, AMQP, MQTT and XMPP are identified as use-case relevant application layer protocols. Section III gives an overview of related work and shows the lack of practical comparison between AMQP, MQTT and XMPP.

So, Asim [5], Gazis et al. [13], Karagiannis et al. [3] and Yassein et al. [14] state out that AMQP, MQTT, XMPP, CoAP and RESTful Services are widely used protocols for IoT applications. Moreover, Al-Fuqaha et al. [9] and Bahga et al. [15] identified DDS as a relevant IoT protocol. Additionally, HTTP and WebSockets are mentioned as IoT protocols by [3], [15]
