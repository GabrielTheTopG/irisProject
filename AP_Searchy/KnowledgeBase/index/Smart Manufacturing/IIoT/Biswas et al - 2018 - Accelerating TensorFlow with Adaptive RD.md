Therefore, this paper proposes a unified approach to have a single gRPC runtime (i.e., AR-gRPC) in TensorFlow with Adaptive and efficient RDMA protocols. In AR- gRPC, we propose designs such as hybrid communication proto- cols, message pipelining and coalescing, zero-copy transmission etc. to make our runtime be adaptive to different message sizes for Deep Learning workloads.

In this paper, we propose a high-performance adaptive RDMA-based communication runtime with gRPC (i.e., AR- gRPC) for distributed TensorFlow. The results suggest that by optimizing the performance of gRPC alone, we can achieve high-performance while keeping a unified communication runtime throughout the TensorFlow stack.This eliminates the need to maintain different server protocols for distributed TensorFlow.
