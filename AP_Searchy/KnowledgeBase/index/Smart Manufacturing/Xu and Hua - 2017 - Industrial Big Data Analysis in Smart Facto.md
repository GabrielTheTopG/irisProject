A. INDUSTRIAL BIG DATA COLLECTION The rapid development of micro-electronic technology, embedded technology, measurement and control technology and communication technology, has achieved significant improvements in data collection methods and data pro- cessing techniques both at home and abroad [10]. In the application background of wireless sensor network (WSN) and the Internet of Things (IoT), large scale sensing data acquisition and transmission has been a hot topic of inves- tigations in recent years and data fusing is a commonly used technique for the acquisition of data processing [11]. Wang [12] proposed the self-adaptive unscented Kalman algorithm and applied this algorithm into industrial IoT to perform data fusion processing. Huang et al. [13] pro- posed the compressive sensing algorithm based on data fusion tree in WSN. Aiming at the problem of wireless location under harsh environment, Prieto et al. [14] pro- posed the self-adaptive data fusion algorithm to enhance the positioning accuracy. Under the environment of intelligent manufacturing, the industrial big data associated with man- 17544 VOLUME 5, 2017X. Xu, Q. Hua: Industrial Big Data Analysis in Smart Factory: Current Status and Research Strategies ufacturing product lines includes the data of equipment con- ditions, products and the manufacturing process, where these data have periodical signals, real-time alarm, and equipment logs, etc. Since the big data associated with product lines are distributed in different locations of manufacturing envi- ronment and there are different types of data, the traditional data fusion schemes aiming at the same signal of multiple data sources, cannot provide good solutions to the problem of efficient acquisition of big data from the manufacturing product lines. In recent years, the software defined industrial IoT [15] and the concept of OPC UA [16] have provided new ways for the big data acquisition and information interaction of product lines under the manufacturing environment. The software defined data acquisition nodes are capable of adapt- ing all sorts of data inputs by means of dynamic configuration of software that has strong flexibility.

C. PREDICTIVE DIAGNOSIS BASED ON BIG DATA The complexity and the scale of modern industrial sys- tems are constantly growing and the corresponding increased faults are influencing the reliability and the effectiveness of the system, which makes the fault diagnosis unprece- dented important [27]. Li et al. [28] proposed the meth- ods of fault detection and diagnosis on all the sensors for the screw chiller system based on the support vector data description algorithm. Hui et al. [29] proposed the support vector machine (SVM)–Dempster-Shafer evidence theory in order to solve the outcome contradiction and classification accuracy problems of SVM. With the rapid development of network, data storage and data acquisition capacities, the traditional schemes on fault prediction and diagnosis in the aspects of feature extraction or model training, are unable to adopt to the present huge volumes, diversity and high-rate of data [30], [31]. In recent years, domestic and foreign scholars have discovered that deep learning has dis- tinctive effects in big data processing of numerous fields. Krizhevsky et al. [32] upgraded the accuracy rate of recogni- tion of ImageNet images from the 74.2% of traditional intel- ligent methods to 83.6% by establishing the deep learning model. Baldi et al. [33] utilized the deep learning scheme to search exotic particles in high energy physics and demon- strated that the deep learning scheme could enhance the searching capabilities of colliders. Hence, some scholars applied the deep learning scheme into the predictive diagnosis of faults in order to satisfy the requirement of predictive diag- nosis in even larger extent under the background of big data. Tamilselvan and Wang [34] innovatively proposed the multi- sensor health diagnostic scheme based on deep learning and used case analysis to demonstrate that the deep belief network categorization model in the health diagnose of complex sys- tems displays even better diagnostic performance in contrast to other categorization schemes. Tran et al. [35] proposed the faults diagnostic method on the reciprocating compressor air valve based on Teager-Kaiser energy operators and deep belief networks. The analysis the failure classification perfor- mance proved that the proposed scheme is highly reliable and adaptable to industrial reciprocating machinery compared to the correlation vector machine and the BP neural network. Jia et al. [36] proposed the intelligent fault diagnostic method for rotational electric machine based on deep neural networks and the diagnostic results indicated that this method VOLUME 5, 2017 17545X. Xu, Q. Hua: Industrial Big Data Analysis in Smart Factory: Current Status and Research Strategies had realized the self-adaptive extraction on the fault char- acteristics of measurement signals and accurate recogni- tion of health status. Aiming at the current status that the fault diagnosis of current sensing electric motors mostly adopts supervising learning to extract the features of faults, Sun et al. [37] proposed a deep neural network that melted the noise-removal coding into sparse automatic coder real- izing the feature extraction of unsupervised learning and applied that to the fault diagnosis of sensing electric motors. The above-mentioned predictive diagnostic schemes based on deep learning mostly assume that the training data is tagged data and apparently are unable to satisfy the necessity of manufacturing big data in product lines. Thus, establishing a predictive diagnostic scheme that can directly perform training on the original signals in time domain will have significant importance.

B. ONTOLOGY MODELING ORIENTED TO THE MANUFACTURING ENVIRONMENT Ontology is originated from Philosophy. Since the Ontol- ogy provides modeling method and deduction mechanism towards the concepts and the mutual relations of a specific domain, it is widely applied in the domains of informa- tion science such as artificial intelligence, semantic network and software engineering [17], [18]. The Ontology mod- eling of a specific application scene in the manufacturing domain provides brand new visual angles to the realiza- tion of detection and alarm, resource allocation of prod- uct lines and performance optimization. Zhang et al. [19] oriented to the astronautical domain, proposed the coop- erative modeling method between astronautical products and performance prototype based on Ontology, and pro- vided theoretical foundations towards the establishment of cooperative model on multi-subject products. Fang et al. [20] established the knowledge Ontology of product design as the bottom layer of framework in order to address the prob- lems such as multi-subject cross and tremendous amount of knowledge resources in the domain of complicated prod- uct design. They introduced the multiple influence factor synthetic weighting and the semantic increment achiev- ing precise retrieval results. Kolchin et al. [21] aimed at the most widely applicable Ontology in the domain of IoT and performed analysis by dividing the Ontology into five major categories. Kotis and Katasonov [22] described the knowledge information of things through the estab- lishment of Ontology model oriented to IoT on the basis of multi-type Ontology such as sensors. In the domain of home automation, Wang and Turner [23] described the elec- tric machine that is the sub-concept of controllable electri- cal system through the establishment of DogOnt Ontology. Wang et al. [24] proposed the comprehensive Ontology ori- ented to knowledge representation that described the concepts such as Ontology service, observation and measurements. Kotis and Katasonov [25] proposed an Ontology model that describes the multiple automated deployments in the heterogeneous IoT. Venkatesh et al. [26] applied statistical learning and the method of Ontology to design a new mid- dleware architecture of IoT providing relatively better solu- tions to the problem of IoT expansion due to heterogeneous data. The above-mentioned schemes achieved the modelling establishment and initial reasoning, but are still unable to provide efficient solution plans to the key problems such as resource allocation and performance optimization under the environment of manufacturing. Nevertheless, these schemes provided brand new styles of thinking on the diagnosis and reconfiguration of product lines under the environment of intelligent manufacturing.

D. GROUP LEARNING OF THE EQUIPMENT ON PRODUCT LINES In the environment of intelligent manufacturing, the authors introduced the previous configuration experience of similar working procedures, achieved the group learning of simi- lar working procedures that will significantly optimize the working efficiency of the equipment on the product lines and reduced the intensity of maintenance. In recent years, scholars from both domestic and abroad conducted several investigations towards the self-adaptive learning, group learn- ing theory and methods regarding to the devices such as industrial robotic arms, mobile robots and have gained some achievements. Wu et al. [38] utilized the radial basis function (RBF) neu- ral network as a mechanical arm with completely unknown parameters and designed a new self-adaptive neural control algorithm in the joint space; RoboEarth [39]. They inte- grated typical applications of multi-class robot tasks and stored the codes of running task that oriented to multi- class robots, which attracted considerable attentions from academic and industrial fields. Seo et al. [40] proposed to exploit Q-learning and cascaded SVM to enable the robots to have the capability of learning. Iwanaga et al. [41] pro- posed the approach of manually evolution, while haven’t totally demonstrated its effectiveness. Arumugam et al. [42] proposed the cloud computation platform DAvinCi based on Hadoop and ROS, in which the data-sharable model was integrated. Riazuelo et al. [43] proposed semantic mapping based on RoboEarth and attempted to construct a universal interface that interacts cloud and the bottom layer. In addition, aiming to grab mechanical hands, multiple research institutes make their own databases public, such as Columbia Grasp dataset [44] and the KIT object dataset in Massachusetts Institute of Technology [45]. Most of the above-described studies, by the association with big data and cloud compu- tation, attempted to realize the technical sharing towards the Robots in the bottom layer in the cloud terminal and thereby achieved group learning. However, under the environment of manufacturing, there are also a large amount of prod- uct line devices that do not integrate hardware such as the embedded equipment does not have the learning capabilities of ‘‘code-level’’ prior technical skills. What they did more is that they referenced the configuration parameters similar as the product line equipment as well as their running effects exhibiting relatively better configuration parameters of simi- lar equipment through the ‘‘learning’’ task and optimized the performance of operations on the equipment. Lee et al. [46] proposed to use similar equipment to establish a practical example of cloning at its cloud terminal, compared and eval- uated the behavior of similar products through the ‘‘snapshot- ting’’ technology and optimized the configuration of bottom layer equipment in order to improve the flexibility and self- adaptability of the equipment. Based on clustering and curve fitting, Wang et al. [47] proposed the prediction mechanism of remaining effective life span based on the similarity of prior samples. Currently, the main objectives of multiple scientific research teams both domestic and abroad, are still to make the group learning on all sorts of Robot equipment as the major tasks and to establish the learning mechanism on all types of product line equipment under the manu- facturing environment that will have significant importance in achieving intelligence and flexible manufacturing and maintenance.

E. RECONFIGURATION OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING PRODUCT LINE The dynamic reconfiguration of manufacturing systems is usually viewed as an important attribution on the system for dealing with inner/outer uncertain factors and strength- ening the elasticity of itself. In recent years, the dynamic reconfiguration of manufacturing system has attracted con- siderable attention from the academics both at home and abroad. Wang et al. [48] pointed out that highly flexible intelligent factories are the keys to deal with the necessity of multi-specification, small batches and personalization, and proposed a type of dynamic reconfiguration mecha- nism that was focused on the alternatively manufacturing of multi-type complete intelligent workpieces. Wang et al. [49] established a reconfiguration time-point decision method for reconfigurable manufacturing systems that simultaneously considered the processing functions and processing capabil- ities. Azaiez et al. [50] constructed the self-organized global framework of manufacturing unit by comprehensively utiliz- ing the techniques such as SDN, OPC uniform structuring and Robot modeling languages. This framework achieved the reconfiguration of manufacturing units through the functions of adding or deleting. Xu et al. [51] considered the problem of process reconfiguration for the reconfigurable manufac- turing system on the expansion capabilities of production, and designed an original and effective method on process reconfiguration. Lope et al. [52] proposed a robust, efficient self-organizational technique based on learning automatic machine theory, ant-colony algorithm and response threshold model to deal with task allocations in the multi-Robot system. Haddou-Benderbal et al. [53] believed that the unavailabil- 17546 VOLUME 5, 2017X. Xu, Q. Hua: Industrial Big Data Analysis in Smart Factory: Current Status and Research Strategies ity of equipment will severely influence the performance of reconfigurable manufacturing systems and designed a hybrid inspirational algorithm that quickly searches the available equipment to substitute the unavailable equipment. Renna and Ambrico [54] determined the required amount, lay- out and workload of equipment when the external demand changes by establishing multiple mathematical models in order to promote smooth reconfiguration process of unit manufacturing system. Sakhaii et al. [55] constructed the integrated hybrid combinative planning model to promote the equipment layout, process improvement and labor arrange- ments inside the dynamic manufacturing unit when equip- ment is not reliable. Delgoshaei and Gomes [56] established a multi-stage scheduling model and supplemented it with several universal inspirational deduction schemes to solve the scheduling problem of unit manufacturing systems in the scene of unreliable equipment and uncertain prime cost. Wu et al. [57] proposed a robust deadlock control strategy based on Petri network aiming at the automatic manufactur- ing system with unreliable resources. The above-described research studies have some sort of reference values towards the study of this research project. However, they are still not fully compatible to the manufacturing domain when the health status of intelligent equipment dynamically changes. The unsolved difficult problems still exist on the reconfig- uration mechanism of intelligent production line under the expected or unexpected failures on equipment.
