- ## Scenarios
#Scenarios #Terminology #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Carroll (2000) goes into great detail on scenario-based design

- ## Heuristic
#Heuristic #InspectionBased #Elicitation #Methods  #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
heuristic evaluation (Nielsen and Mack, 1994)

- ## TaskCentered
#TaskCentered #Walkthrough #ModelBased #Elicitation #Methods  #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
task centered walkthrough of it  (Nielson and Mack 1994). With a walkthrough, you tell a concrete story about what a  particular user would do and see step-by-step when performing his or her particular task  on the interface (Carroll, 2000)

- ## TaskCentered
#TaskCentered #Walkthrough #ModelBased #Elicitation #Methods  #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Walkthroughs are an excellent and low-cost way to evaluate your interface, for you  will quickly discover trouble spots as you move through the task.

most systems are considered successful if they have about 90% coverage, that is, if 90%  of the people can do 90% of the tasks reasonably well. This also means that these systems  exclude 10% of the people and tasks.

- ## TCSD
#TCSD #Usability #Evaluation #Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Clayton Lewis and John Rieman introduced Task Centered System Design  (TCSD), a highly practical discount-usability engineering methodology (Lewis and  Reiman, 1993).

- ## TCSD
#TCSD #Usability #Evaluation #Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
articulate concrete descriptions of real-world people

- ## TCSD
#TCSD #Usability #Evaluation #Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
use these descriptions to determine which users and what tasks the system should  support

- ## TCSD
#TCSD #Usability #Evaluation #Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
prototype an interface that satisfy these requirements

- ## TCSD
#TCSD #Usability #Evaluation #Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
evaluate the interface by performing a task-centered walkthrough.

- ## Task
#Task #Identification #TCSD #Usability #Evaluation #Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
identify specific users of the system  and articulate example realistic tasks that they would do. Your goal is to produce a  manageable list of representative users and tasks that give realistic coverage of who  would use the system to do what kinds of tasks

- ## Task
#Task #Identification #TCSD #Usability #Evaluation #Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Observe them as they do their task activities,  and interview them about what they are doing (Beyer and Holtzblatt, 1998).

- ## Task
#Task #Identification #TCSD #Usability #Evaluation #Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
When all else fails: Make your beliefs of the end-users and task space explicit. If you  cannot get in touch with real end-users or their representatives, use your team members  to articulate expected end-users and tasks

- ## Task
#Task #Description #TCSD #Usability #Evaluation #Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
describes what the user wants to do but does not say how the user would do it

- ## Task
#Task #Description #TCSD #Usability #Evaluation #Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
description is concrete. It says exactly what the user wants to do,  including the actual items the user would eventually want to input

- ## Task
#Task #Description #TCSD #Usability #Evaluation #Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
The description should flow through all aspects of the task,  starting at the very beginning and concluding at the very end

- ## Task
#Task #Description #TCSD #Usability #Evaluation #Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
description should name  real people, and should include what they know or don’t know about performing the task  and using computers.

- ## Task
#Task #Description #TCSD #Usability #Evaluation #Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
task descriptions identify a broad coverage of users and task types.  Collectively, the descriptions should identify the typical ‘expected’ users, the occasional  but still important users, and the unusual users

- ## Task
#Task #Validation #TCSD #Usability #Evaluation #Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
reality check of your task  descriptions. You can do this by circulating a description back to the person it is  describing, or to the end-user representatives who regularly interact with them in their  task setting. These people should see if it fairly summarizes the activities
