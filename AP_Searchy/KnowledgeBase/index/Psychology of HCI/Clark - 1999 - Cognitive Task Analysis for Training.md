Two factors have made behaviorally-based task analysis training systems obsolete: 1) these systems cannot describe  the complex knowledge required of European and North American workers by recent changes in the global  economy, and 2) recent research in cognition show that the cognitive processes and structures involved in complex work tasks serve as a more useful content for training and development

Cooke (1992a) defines CTA as the general term used to describe a set of methods and techniques that specify the  cognitive structures and processes associated with task performance. The focal point is the underlying cognitive  processes, rather than observable behaviors. Another defining characteristic of CTA is an attempt to describe the  differences between novices and experts in the development of knowledge about tasks (Redding, 1989).

In contrast with behavioral strategies, CTA examines knowledge in far greater depth

Behavioral  approaches focus on what performers do, while cognitive analyses focus protocols on identifying what expert and  novice performers think about before, during, and after each job task.

here are also a number of questions around the interaction of declarative and procedural knowledge. What is  the mechanism by which declarative knowledge becomes procedural?
