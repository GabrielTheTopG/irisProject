- ## EOFM
#EOFM #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Note that the EOFM is appro- priate for this work because it is an expressive task analytic modeling language. It also has formal semantics, which provide an unambiguous, mathematical description of how task models execute. These are used as the basis for the taxonomy.

- ## EOFM
#EOFM #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
EOFM (Bolton et al., 2011) is a formal task analytic modeling lan- guage derived from the Operator Function Model (OFM; Mitchell and Miller 1986; Thurman et al. 1998). The language is XML-based and al- lows for the modeling of human behavior, either individuals or groups, as an input/output system. Inputs may come from other elements of the system like human-device interfaces or the environment. Output vari- ables are human actions.

- ## Characteristics
#Characteristics #EOFM #Task #Models #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
EOFM, the task analytic modeling system around which the new tax- onomy is based, is unique within the formal task model community. Specifically, EOFM is automata-based while other common task model- ing formalisms such as CTT (Paternò et al., 1997) and the system used by Fields (2001) are based on process algebras

As such, the taxonomy enu- merated here should be readily adaptable to the detection of erroneous behavior at runtime. Because our taxonomy contextualizes the actual erroneous behavior manifestation with environmental information con- tained in strategic knowledge conditions, it should provide more infor- mation than simply detecting and identifying the behavior’s erroneous phenotype.

Bastide and Basnyat (2007) and Fields (2001) showed how patterns of erroneous human be- havior, mostly based on the phenotypes of erroneous behavior, could be manually used to modify normative human task behavior

- ## THEA
#THEA #Human #Error #Detection #Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
THEA (Technique for Human Error Assessment) system (Fields et al., 1997; Pocock et al., 2001a, 2001b) explored systematic ways that be- havior could deviate from tasks based on Norman’s execution evaluation cycle model of human information processing (Norman, 1988)

(HAZOP; Dunjó et al. 2010; Lawley 1974). Fields (2001) and Bastide and Basnyat (2007) identified specific pat- terns of human task behavior that could be manually inserted into task models to replicate erroneous behavior in simulation and formal veri- fication analyzes

- ## THERP
#THERP #Human #Error #Detection #Applications #Task #Modelling #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
There are a number of such techniques including THERP (technique for human error-rate prediction; Swain and Guttmann, 1983)

- ## Task
#Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Erroneous behavior is often a product of poorly designed human in- teraction and is thus enabled by the tasks of the system (Hollnagel, 1993; Reason, 1990; Sheridan and Parasuraman, 2005).

- ## Taxonomies
#Taxonomies #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
The two leading general taxonomies are Reason’s (1990) Generic Error Modeling System (GEMS) and Hollnagel’s (1993) phenotypes of erroneous action.

- ## Taxonomies
#Taxonomies #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Both taxonomies can be related to task models, but in different ways. The phenotypes of erroneous action assume a normative plan of actions that is being observed. A task model is a normative plan.

- ## Erroneous
#Erroneous #Behavior #Classification #Taxonomies #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Below we formulate our erroneous human behavior taxonomy that classifies erroneous behaviors formally based on where in a normative task model deviations occur

- ## Erroneous

Summary of erroneous behavior classifications using the new taxonomy.

- ## Erroneous
#Erroneous #Behavior #Classification #Taxonomies #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Our taxonomy is capable of accounting for the different classifications in the phenotypes of er- roneous action (Hollnagel, 1993) as well as the skill-based slips from GEMS (Reason, 1990).

- ## Erroneous
#Erroneous #Behavior #Classification #Taxonomies #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
the new taxonomy encapsulated erroneous behavior types, such as post- completion errors (represented as an activity post-completion omission in our taxonomy), that have gained importance in the larger human fac- tors literature (Bastide and Basnyat, 2007; Byrne and Bovair, 1997; Cur- zon and Blandford, 2004; Li et al., 2005)

- ## Erroneous
#Erroneous #Behavior #Classification #Taxonomies #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
taxonomy identifies a number of new and/or precise erroneous behavior types including ac- tivity completed intrusions; activity repeat-capture intrusions; activity post-repetitions; activity premature, pre-capture restarts; activity non- completions; and many different combinations of these and other types. This suggests that some or all of these special types may be deserving of additional study in future research.

- ## Erroneous
#Erroneous #Behavior #Classification #Taxonomies #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Our taxonomy is compatible with slips from Reason’s GEMS (1990). However, as discussed in Section 4.2, our taxonomy only accounts for why an erroneous behavior occurred based on what information the human operator failed to properly attend to. It does not specifically describe higher levels of classifications that relate to why the partic- ular failures of attention could occur (such as distraction)

- ## Erroneous
#Erroneous #Behavior #Classification #Taxonomies #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
As we have shown, this new taxonomy is compat- ible with the two leading erroneous behavior taxonomies and thus sup- ports the different classifications they encompass

- ## GenotypePhenotype
#GenotypePhenotype #ory #Taxonomies #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Hollnagel (1993) classified erroneous human behaviors based on their phenotype: how erroneous behavior observably deviates from a normative plan of actions. In this taxonomy, erroneous behaviors are composed of one or more erroneous acts, all capable of being detected by observing the performance of a single action in a plan

- ## GenotypePhenotype
#GenotypePhenotype #ory #Taxonomies #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Hollnagel’s (1993) phenotypes of erroneous action.

- ## GenotypePhenotype
#GenotypePhenotype #ory #Taxonomies #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Hollnagel’s phenotypes have been predominately used for activities such as detecting the presence of human errors in monitors (Hollnagel, 1993), methods for generating and/or exploring erroneous behavior in model-based analyzes with defined normative plans of ac- tion

- ## GEMS
#GEMS #Taxonomies #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
In contrast to Hollnagel, Reason (1990) classified erroneous behav- iors based on their cognitive causes, their genotypes. Reason identified three types of errors based on Rasmussen’s SRK (Skills, Rules, Knowl- edge) framework (Rasmussen, 1983). That is, errors could occur at any of the three levels of human information processing. Skill-based failures (slips) occur when the human operator knows how to perform a task and intends to do it correctly

- ## GEMS
#GEMS #Taxonomies #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Reason’s GEMS has found more use in its ability to help system analysts and designers understand what causes erroneous behavior so that the system can be designed to support the level of work

- ## GEMS
#GEMS #Taxonomies #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
GEMS has served as the basis for erroneous human behavior classi- fication in accident analyzes and event reporting. This includes the Hu- man Factors Analysis and Classification System (which is generic but 119M.L. Bolton Int. J. Human-Computer Studies 108 (2017) 105–121 predominately used in aviation; Shappell and Wiegmann, 2000)

- ## Error
#Error #Classifactions #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Rule-based mistakes occur when the human has learned to do something wrong (has the wrong rule) or has prob- lems remembering how to do the procedure at the time of execution. Knowledge-based mistakes relate to logical fallacies, incomplete knowl- edge, or limitations on other available information.

- ## Human
#Human #Reliability #Assessement #HRA #Error #Detection #Methods #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
This is purview of human reliability analyzes ([Bell and Holroyd, 2009]). Human reliability analyzes attempt to qualitatively and/or quantitatively assess the probability of erroneous human behav- ior
