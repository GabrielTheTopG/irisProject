- ## Task
#Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
A mistake is defined, following Norman (1981) and Reason (1979), as a planning  failure, i.e., an error of judgment or inference where the actions go as planned but where the  plan was incorrect

A slip is correspondingly defined as an action that is not in accord with the  actor’s intention, i.e., the result of a good plan poorly executed (cf. the discussion in Moray &  Senders, 1989). A slip is clearly a case of “action not as planned”, but the concept must be  further refined to be of practical use.

source for defining the complex phenotypes of erroneous actions is the classification  system or taxonomy for event reports developed by Rasmussen et al. (1981).

- ## GenotypePhenotype

Erroneous actions are predictable both in form and frequency  and it is therefore possible - in principle as well as in practice - significantly to reduce their  number

best remedy is to improve the working conditions (the  information environment) by providing the human with the appropriate tools and by amplifying human strengths rather than reducing human weaknesses.

different ways to consider erroneous actions. One is with regard  to their phenotype, i.e., how they appear in over action, how they can be observed, hence the  empirical basis for their classification. The other is with regard to their genotype, i.e., the  functional characteristics of the human cognitive system that are assumed to be a contributing  cause of the erroneous actions

- ## GenotypePhenotype
#GenotypePhenotype #ory #Taxonomies #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
they can be used to detect the  individual cases but do not necessarily help to identify the underlying causes.

- ## GenotypePhenotype
#GenotypePhenotype #ory #Taxonomies #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
The phenotype is useful for  detection, but since it does not provide any explanation, it cannot be used for correction and  improvement. For that purpose a genotype (i.e., a theory) is needed. This amounts more or  less to a model description of human erroneous behaviour, which can be useful in clarifying  how the User-System Interaction takes place, hence how it can be improved when necessary.

- ## GenotypePhenotype
#GenotypePhenotype #ory #Taxonomies #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
The real value of the taxonomy, and possibly of the empirical data from an application,  will be to identify problems areas in User-System Interaction, which can then be used to  improve the design, not by introducing additional systems, but by reducing the complexity of  the User-System Interaction to avoid the erroneous actions from occurring.

- ## Phenotypes
#Phenotypes #GenotypePhenotype #ory #Taxonomies #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Action in wrong place. Here the action belongs to the current sequence, but is  placed incorrectly.

- ## Phenotypes
#Phenotypes #GenotypePhenotype #ory #Taxonomies #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
One simple phenotype is repetition, i.e., an action is a repetition of the previous  action

- ## Phenotypes
#Phenotypes #GenotypePhenotype #ory #Taxonomies #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
restart, i.e., that an  already completed segment of the action sequence is repeated, possibly from the  very beginning, starting with a jump backwards.

- ## Phenotypes
#Phenotypes #GenotypePhenotype #ory #Taxonomies #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
reversal, i.e., the next two actions in the expected  sequence are reversed.

- ## Phenotypes
#Phenotypes #GenotypePhenotype #ory #Taxonomies #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
jumping, i.e.,  segments longer than one action are reversed or more than one action is skipped

- ## Phenotypes
#Phenotypes #GenotypePhenotype #ory #Taxonomies #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
omission, i.e., that the expected action is missing.  There are two complex phenotypes that correspond to this

- ## Phenotypes
#Phenotypes #GenotypePhenotype #ory #Taxonomies #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
side-tracking, where a segment or Phenotype of Erroneous Actions Page 21 sequence of unrelated actions is carried out before the current action sequence is  resumed.

- ## Phenotypes
#Phenotypes #GenotypePhenotype #ory #Taxonomies #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
more than one action  is omitted we effectively have a case of jumping forwards

- ## Phenotypes
#Phenotypes #GenotypePhenotype #ory #Taxonomies #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
f the rest  of the action sequence is omitted, we have a case of undershoot, i.e., that an  action sequence is not completed as planned

- ## Phenotypes
#Phenotypes #GenotypePhenotype #ory #Taxonomies #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Action at wrong time. The simple phenotype omission could also occur if the  action was not carried out when it was required

- ## Phenotypes
#Phenotypes #GenotypePhenotype #ory #Taxonomies #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
delay, i.e., that an action does not occur when it is  required. A true delay means that the sequence of the following actions is  maintained

- ## Phenotypes
#Phenotypes #GenotypePhenotype #ory #Taxonomies #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
premature action, i.e., that an action occurs when  no action was expected.

- ## Phenotypes
#Phenotypes #GenotypePhenotype #ory #Taxonomies #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Action of wrong type. This category means that the action was incorrect although  not so wrong that it disrupted the on-going plan.

- ## Phenotypes
#Phenotypes #GenotypePhenotype #ory #Taxonomies #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
replacement, i.e., that the action is a proper substitute  for the expected action. The two actions are functionally equivalent in the sense  that the replacement does not invalidate the conditions that must remain for the  continuation of the action sequence

- ## Phenotypes
#Phenotypes #GenotypePhenotype #ory #Taxonomies #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Action not included in current plan. Here the action does not belong to the  current action sequence.

- ## Phenotypes
#Phenotypes #GenotypePhenotype #ory #Taxonomies #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
insertion, which occurs if the action does not belong to  the action sequence and if it does not disrupt it

- ## Phenotypes
#Phenotypes #GenotypePhenotype #ory #Taxonomies #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
intrusion, which occurs if the action does not  belong to the action sequence, and if it disrupts it.

- ## Phenotypes
#Phenotypes #GenotypePhenotype #ory #Taxonomies #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
capture, which means that the  action sequence is effectively disrupted and replaced by a rivalling (and probably  more dominant) action sequence

- ## Phenotypes
#Phenotypes #GenotypePhenotype #ory #Taxonomies #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
branching, which means than an  action segment, which is common to two or more action sequences, is continued  along the wrong action sequence

- ## Phenotypes
#Phenotypes #GenotypePhenotype #ory #Taxonomies #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
overshoot, which means that an  action sequence is continued beyond its end point, i.e., after the goal criteria have  been satisfied.

- ## Error
#Error #Classifactions #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
The error- shaping factors are the following:

- ## Error
#Error #Classifactions #Task #Execution #Errors #Task #Analysis  #Modeling 
Control-mode failure:   Double-capture slip (attention is captured and, as a result a dominant plan takes  over).   Place-losing and place-mistaking errors (not knowing one’s place in the action  sequence).   Intention system failure:   Detached intentions (incorrect action sequence carried out, not related to goal).   Lost intentions (forgetting intention with current action, not attaining goal).   Action system failures:   Blends (confusion between action sequences, reversal of actions).   External activation of action schemata (automatic triggering of incorrect action  sequence).   Program counter failure.   Input function failures:   Perceptual confusion (confusing objects or functions).   Local unawareness (not really knowing what one is doing).

Another problem is the rate of alerts, in particular the false alarm rate. In any concrete  situation it is important that a proper balance is attained, which neither tires the user nor  misses clearly serious events. The precise level will depend on the context as well as on the  system demands (e.g. the difference between aircraft and word processors), and may also be  determined by the needs of the user

A plan is defined to consist of a goal and a set of actions with  constraints which when met achieve that goal. A complex plan may consist of a  number of sub-goals as well as actions which may be optional or replaceable.  Actions may have time, fact, and equality constraints
