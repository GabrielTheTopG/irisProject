Valuation is the process of determining the economic value of an asset, be it a  product, a service, or a process. In simple terms, value is defined as the net worth,  or the difference between the benefits and the costs of the asset, all adjusted ap- propriately for risk, at a given point in time. When the costs are disregarded, are  implicit, or have been incurred before the point at which an asset is evaluated, the  value may refer to future benefits or the remaining worth of the asset at that point.  Several factors make valuation a difficult endeavor:

Costs and benefits might occur at different points in time and need to be  downward adjusted, or discounted, to account for time value of money: the fun- damental principle that money is worth more today than in the future under or- dinary economic conditions. Discounted Cash Flow and related techniques  handle time value of money. These are illustrated in the earlier parts of Section  3.3.  â€¢ Not all determinants of value are known at the time of the valuation due to un- certainty inherent in the environment. Modeling uncertainty is more often an art  than a science. Section 3.3 shows how decision tree and options-based ap- proaches can help address uncertainty.
