The available methods of performing this evaluation, e.g. those based on return-on-investment (ROI), provide a measure of the absolute business value only at the end of a software initiative. In comparison, the requirement here is to evaluate the business value at a relative early stage in the project, for which the ROI method appears inadequate.

Business value expands the concept of value of the organisation beyond economic value (i.e. economic profit) to include other forms of value such as employee value, customer value, supplier value, channel partner value, alliance partner value, managerial value and societal value.

The business values in turn can be combined into related categories which are known as business value dimensions (BVDs)

Business process: A business function can be broken up into several processes. A business process indicates how the work identified by the business function can be accomplished.

Non-functional requirements (NFRs): These represent the services or functions offered by the system (in our case, the scenario). These apply to the system as a whole, and describe the capabilities of the system.

the project team will be able to arrive at a measure of the technical soundness of the scenario at the bottom-most business process level. This measure is designated as the technical assessment score (TAS) of the scenario,
