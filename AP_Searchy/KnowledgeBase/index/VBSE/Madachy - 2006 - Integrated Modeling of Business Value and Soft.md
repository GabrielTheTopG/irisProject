value-based product model can support  software business decision-making by using risk consequence to find the quality  sweet spot with respect to ROI. The following analysis steps are performed to find  the process sweet spot:  • vary reliability across runs  • assess risk consequences of opposing trends: market delays and bad qual- ity losses  • sum market losses and development costs  • calculate resulting net revenue to find process optimum.

Two major aspects of stakeholder value are addressed here. One is the business  value to the development organization stemming from software sales. Another is the  value to the end-user stakeholder from varying feature sets and quality. Production  functions relating different aspects of value to their costs were developed and are  included in the integrated model.

account for feedback loops to generate revised  product specifications (closed-loop control). This feedback includes:  • external feedback from user to incorporate new features  • internal feedback on product initiatives from an organizational planning and  control entity to the software process.

For simplification, software reliability as defined in the COCOMO II model [4] is  used as a proxy for all quality practices. It models the tradeoff between reliability and  development cost. There are four different settings of reliability from low to very  high that correspond to four development options.

The product defect model can be enhanced with a dynamic version of  COQUALMO [5] to enable more constructive insight into quality practices. This  would replace the current construct based on the single factor for required software  reliability.
