value- neutral setting, in which:  • Every requirement, use case, object, test case, and defect is treated as equally  important;  • Methods are presented and practiced as largely logical activities involving  mappings and transformations (e.g., object-oriented development);  • “Earned value” systems track project cost and schedule, not stakeholder or  business value;  • A “separation of concerns” is practiced, in which the responsibility of software  engineers is confined to turning software requirements into verified code.

value-neutral software engineering principles and practices are unable to  deal with most of the sources of software project failure. Major studies such as the  Standish Group’s CHAOS reports1 find that most software project failures are  caused by value-oriented shortfalls such as lack of user input, incomplete require- ments, changing requirements, lack of resources, unrealistic expectations, unclear  objectives, and unrealistic time frames.  Further, value-neutral methods are insufficient as a basis of an engineering dis- cipline. The definition of “engineering” in (Webster, 2002) is “the application of  science and mathematics by which the properties of matter and sources of energy  in nature are made useful to people.” Most concerns expressed about the adequacy  of software engineering focus on the shortfalls in its underlying science. But it is  also hard for a value-neutral approach to provide guidance for making its products  useful to people, as this involves dealing with different people’s utility functions  or value propositions.
