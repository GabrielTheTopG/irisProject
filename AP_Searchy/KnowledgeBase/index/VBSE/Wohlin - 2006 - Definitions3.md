The real challenge for software developers is to understand factors that drive  organizational value creation and how to influence them. Value depends on the re- lationship between customer needs and the benefits of products that satisfy those  needs. Value is created when software developers provide products that satisfy  customer needs (Alwis et al., 2003). However, focusing on value to a specific cus- tomer may lead to the exclusion of considering value to other stakeholders, includ- ing other customers, different markets, software developers, and project managers.  This may jeopardize the long-term viability of the software company. Since cus- tomers have different needs and desires that vary with time, software companies  are forced to create value along many dimensions, including economical, physical,  emotional, social, cognitive and political dimensions (Nunamaker et al., 2001).

During a software  product’s life cycle, market values change and different characteristics become  dominant and drive business. If we can understand how market values vary during  the life cycle, it would be easier to identify process models with attributes that  highlight market values in a particular stage.

In the context of product development, value includes both product and process  attributes. Browning et al. (2002) argue that product value is affected not only by  the presence of necessary activities in the product development process, but also  by the way those activities work together to ensure that they use and produce the 182 Claes Wohlin, Aybüke Aurum  right information. The value of a product to a customer depends on customer pref- erences and alternatives, as addressed in economics, marketing, and value engi- neering literature (Browning, 2003; Deaton and Muellbauer, 1980; Park, 1998;  Urban and Hauser, 1993).

In the context of software engineering, value creation involves gaining new in- sights or discovering new patterns of knowledge at the process level, product  level, or resources level. Information and knowledge transfer to stakeholders fa- cilitates value creation.

According to economics and management science, an organization’s ability to  create value (in relation to its goals) depends on the utilization of intellectual capi- tal (Drucker, 1998; Prahalad and Hamel, 1990). Intellectual capital is the sum of  organizational knowledge which includes ideas, inventions, technologies, software  programs, designs, processes, and creativity – which all can be converted to profit,  create value, and give organizations a competitive edge (Alwis et al., 2003; Sulli- van, 1998).
