The organization introducing an information system must be distinguished from  the actual users who interact with the system, and whose interests and demands on  the system might be quite different (Boehm, 2003). A similar distinction can be  made on the development side, where the interests of individual developers (like  becoming familiar with some new technology) might be different from those of  the company employing them (which could, for example, be interested in lowering  development costs). Considering the diverse interests of various stakeholder  groups increases the number of criteria to be used.
