The goal of software engineering is to create products, services, and processes that  add value. People who contribute to the creation of these artifacts – analysts, proc- ess engineers, software engineers, testers, managers, executives – strive in their  decisions and actions to maximize some simple or complex notion of value,  whether consciously or unconsciously, and whether with respect to shared goals or  to satisfy personal objectives. Alas, when value considerations remain implicit, the  overall effect may very well be negative. Examples of undesirable consequences  of implicit and clashing value perspectives abound. A good case in point is when  developers value superior design, the marketing of new, nifty functionality, qual- ity assurance “zero defects” and the management of short time-to-market. Another  example is when product quality is pursued for quality’s sake with little regard to  shareholder value (Favaro, 1996). Yet another is when management tries to drive  development costs down by treating developers as a replaceable commodity or by  evaluating them using one-dimensional performance metrics, and the development  team reacts by creating knowledge silos or by “coding to rule” to protect its own  interests. If value perspectives are not explicated and reconciled, everybody loses  in the end.

Value-based software engineering (VBSE) brings such value considerations to  the foreground so that software engineering decisions at all levels can be opti- mized to meet or reconcile explicit objectives of the involved stakeholders, from  marketing staff and business analysts to developers, architects, and quality ex- perts, and from process and measurement experts to project managers and execu- tives. In VBSE, decisions are not made in a setting blind to value perspectives,  whether common or differing, of these project participants.

The value-based management movement of the early 1990s (McTaggart, 1994)  inspired an IEEE Software essay entitled “When the Pursuit of Quality Destroys  Value” (Favaro, 1996). This essay made the controversial argument that superior  quality should not be a goal in itself in the absence of favorable economics.  Favaro et al. used the adjective “value-based” in the software development context  in a later article addressing the economics of software reuse (Favaro et al., 1998).
